In November 1995, my friend Ruth Holland, book reviews editor of the British Medical Journal, suggested that I write a book to demystify the important but often inaccessible subject of evidence-based medicine. She provided invaluable comments on the original draft of the manuscript, but was tragically killed in a train crash on 8th August 1996. This book is dedicated to her memory.

Foreword to the first edition by Professor Sir David Weatherall

Not surprisingly, the wide publicity given to what is now called evidence-based medicine has been greeted with mixed reactions by those who are involved in the provision of patient care. The bulk of the medical profession appears to be slightly hurt by the concept, suggesting as it does that until recently all medical practice was what Lewis Thomas has described as a frivolous and irresponsible kind of human experimentation, based on nothing but trial and error, and usually resulting in precisely that sequence. On the other hand, politicians and those who administrate our health services have greeted the notion with enormous glee. They had suspected all along that doctors were totally uncritical and now they had it on paper. Evidence-based medicine came as a gift from the gods because, at least as they perceived it, its implied efficiency must inevitably result in cost saving.

The concept of controlled clinical trials and evidence-based medicine is not new, however. It is recorded that Frederick II, Emperor of the Romans and King of Sicily and Jerusalem, who lived from 1192 to 1250 AD, and who was interested in the effects of exercise on digestion, took two knights and gave them identical meals. One was then sent out hunting and the other ordered to bed. At the end of several hours he killed both and examined the contents of their alimentary canals; digestion had proceeded further in the stomach of the sleeping knight. In the 17th century Jan Baptista van Helmont, a physician and philosopher, became sceptical of the practice of blood-letting. Hence he proposed what was almost certainly the first clinical trial involving large numbers, randomisation and statistical analysis. This involved taking 200–500 poor people, dividing them into two groups by casting lots, and protecting one from phlebotomy while allowing the other to be treated with as much blood-letting as his colleagues thought appropriate. The number of funerals in each group would be used to assess the efficacy of blood-letting. History does not record why this splendid experiment was never carried out.

If modern scientific medicine can be said to have had a beginning it was in Paris in the mid-19th century and where it had its roots in the work and teachings of Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis. Louis introduced statistical

analysis to the evaluation of medical treatment and, incidentally, showed that blood‐letting was a valueless form of treatment, although this did not change the habits of the physicians of the time, or for many years to come. Despite this pioneering work, few clinicians on either side of the Atlantic urged that trials of clinical outcome should be adopted, although the principles of numerically based experimental design were enunciated in the 1920s by the geneticist Ronald Fisher. The field only started to make a major impact on clinical practice after the Second World War following the seminal work of Sir Austin Bradford Hill and the British epidemiologists who followed him, notably Richard Doll and Archie Cochrane.

But although the idea of evidence‐based medicine is not new, modern disciples like David Sackett and his colleagues are doing a great service to clinical practice, not just by popularising the idea, but by bringing home to clinicians the notion that it is not a dry academic subject but more a way of thinking that should permeate every aspect of medical practice. While much of it is based on mega‐trials and meta‐analyses, it should also be used to influence almost everything that a doctor does. After all, the medical profession has been brain‐washed for years by examiners in medical schools and Royal Colleges to believe that there is only one way of examining a patient. Our bedside rituals could do with as much critical evaluation as our operations and drug regimes; the same goes for almost every aspect of doctoring.

As clinical practice becomes busier, and time for reading and reflection becomes even more precious, the ability effectively to peruse the medical literature and, in the future, to become familiar with a knowledge of best practice from modern communication systems, will be essential skills for doctors. In this lively book, Trisha Greenhalgh provides an excellent approach to how to make best use of medical literature and the benefits of evidence‐based medicine. It should have equal appeal for first year medical students and grey‐haired consultants, and deserves to be read widely.

With increasing years, the privilege of being invited to write a foreword to a book by one’s ex‐students becomes less of a rarity. Trisha Greenhalgh was the kind of medical student who never let her teachers get away with a loose thought and this inquiring attitude seems to have flowered over the years; this is a splendid and timely book and I wish it all the success it deserves. After all, the concept of evidence‐based medicine is nothing more than the state of mind that every clinical teacher hopes to develop in their students; Dr Greenhalgh’s skeptical but constructive approach to medical literature suggests that such a happy outcome is possible at least once in the lifetime of a professor of medicine.

# Preface to the sixth edition

When I wrote this book in 1996, evidence‐based medicine was a bit of an unknown quantity. A handful of academics (including me) were already enthusiastic and had begun running ‘training the trainers’ courses to disseminate what we saw as a highly logical and systematic approach to clinical practice. Others – certainly the majority of clinicians – were convinced that this was a passing fad that was of limited importance and would never catch on. I wrote How to Read a Paper for two reasons. First, students on my own courses were asking for a simple introduction to the principles presented in what was then known as ‘Dave Sackett’s big red book’ (Sackett DL, Haynes RB, Guyatt GH, Tugwell P. Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine. London, Little, Brown & Co., 1991) – an outstanding and inspirational volume that was already in its fourth reprint, but which some novices apparently found a hard read. Second, it was clear to me that many of the critics of evidence‐based medicine didn’t really understand what they were dismissing – and that until they did, serious debate on the clinical, pedagogical and even political place of evidence‐based medicine as a discipline could not begin.

I am of course delighted that How to Read a Paper has become a standard reader in many medical and nursing schools, and that so far it has been translated into 20 languages including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Polish, Japanese, Czech and Russian. I am also delighted that what was so recently a fringe subject in academia has been well and truly mainstreamed in clinical service. In the UK, for example, it is now a contractual requirement for all doctors, nurses and pharmacists to practise (and for managers to manage) according to best research evidence.

In the 23 years since the first edition of this book was published, evidence‐based medicine (and, more broadly, evidence‐based healthcare) has waxed and waned in popularity. Hundreds of textbooks and tens of thousands of journal articles now offer different angles on the ‘basics of EBM’ covered briefly in the chapters that follow. An increasing number of these sources point out genuine limitations of evidence‐based healthcare in certain contexts. Others look at evidence‐based medicine and healthcare as a social

movement – a ‘bandwagon’ that took off at a particular time (the 1990s) and
place (North America) and spread quickly with all sorts of knock‐on effects
for particular interest groups.

When preparing this sixth edition, I began with no fewer than 11 reviews
of the previous edition, mostly from students who are the book’s main target
audience. They wanted updated references, more worked examples, more
(and better) pictures and some questions to aid reflection at the end of each
chapter. I’ve added all these, along with a new chapter on population genetics
and big data. I did not change much else, because there is clearly still room
on the bookshelves for a no‐frills introductory text. Since the publication of
the fifth edition, I have written a new book on How to Implement Evidence‐
Based Healthcare, so I have removed the (now somewhat outdated) chapter
on implementation that was included in the fourth and fifth editions.

As ever, I would welcome any feedback that will help make the text more
accurate, readable and practical.

Preface to the first edition: do you need to read this book?

This book is intended for anyone, whether medically qualified or not, who wishes to find their way into the medical and healthcare literature, assess the scientific validity and practical relevance of the articles they find, and, where appropriate, put the results into practice. These skills constitute the basics of evidence-based medicine (if you’re thinking about what doctors do) or evidence-based healthcare (if you’re looking at the care of patients more widely).

I hope this book will improve your confidence in reading and interpreting papers relating to clinical decision-making. I hope, in addition, to convey a further message, which is this. Many of the descriptions given by cynics of what evidence-based healthcare is (the glorification of things that can be measured without regard for the usefulness or accuracy of what is measured, the uncritical acceptance of published numerical data, the preparation of all-encompassing guidelines by self-appointed ‘experts’ who are out of touch with real medicine, the debasement of clinical freedom through the imposition of rigid and dogmatic clinical protocols, and the over-reliance on simplistic, inappropriate and often incorrect economic analyses) are actually criticisms of what the evidence-based healthcare movement is fighting against, rather than of what it represents.

Do not, however, think of me as an evangelist for the gospel according to evidence-based healthcare. I believe that the science of finding, evaluating and implementing the results of clinical research can, and often does, make patient care more objective, more logical and more cost-effective. If I didn’t believe that, I wouldn’t spend so much of my time teaching it and trying, as a doctor, to practise it. Nevertheless, I believe that when applied in a vacuum (that is, in the absence of common sense and without regard to the individual circumstances and priorities of the person being offered treatment or to the complex nature of clinical practice and policy-making), ‘evidence-based’ decision-making is a reductionist process with a real potential for harm.

Finally, you should note that I am neither an epidemiologist nor a statistician, but a person who reads papers and who has developed a pragmatic
---
(and at times unconventional) system for testing their merits. If you wish to pursue the epidemiological or statistical themes covered in this book, I would encourage you to move on to a more definitive text, references for which you will find at the end of each chapter.

# Chapter 1 Why read papers at all?

Does ‘evidence-based medicine’ simply mean ‘reading papers in medical journals’?

Evidence-based medicine (EBM), which is part of the broader field of evidence-based healthcare (EBHC), is much more than just reading papers. According to what is still (more than 20 years after it was written) the most widely quoted definition, it is ‘the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients’ [1]. I find this definition very useful but it misses out what for me is a very important aspect of the subject – and that is the use of mathematics. Even if you know almost nothing about EBHC, you probably know it talks a lot about numbers and ratios! Anna Donald and I decided to be upfront about this in our own teaching, and proposed this alternative definition:

Evidence-based medicine is pe use of mapematical estimates of pe risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in pe diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients.

The defining feature of EBHC, then, is the use of figures derived from research on populations to inform decisions about individuals. This, of course, begs the question ‘What is research?’ – for which a reasonably accurate answer might be ‘Focused, systematic enquiry aimed at generating new knowledge.’ In later chapters, I explain how this definition can help you distinguish genuine research (which should inform your practice) from the poor-quality endeavours of well-meaning amateurs (which you should politely ignore).

If you follow an evidence-based approach to clinical decision-making, therefore, all sorts of issues relating to your patients (or, if you work in public

You might ask questions, for example, about a patient’s symptoms ('In a 34‐year‐old man with left‐sided chest pain, what is the probability that there is a serious heart problem, and, if there is, will it show up on a resting ECG?'), about physical or diagnostic signs ('In an otherwise uncomplicated labour, does the presence of meconium [indicating fetal bowel movement] in the amniotic fluid indicate significant deterioration in the physiological state of the fetus?'), about the prognosis of an illness ('If a previously well 2‐year‐old has a short fit associated with a high temperature, what is the chance that she will subsequently develop epilepsy?'), about therapy ('In patients with an acute coronary syndrome [heart attack], are the risks associated with thrombolytic drugs [clot busters] outweighed by the benefits, whatever the patient’s age, sex and ethnic origin?'), about cost‐effectiveness ('Is the cost of this new anti‐cancer drug justified, compared with other ways of spending limited healthcare resources?'), about patients’ preferences ('In an 87‐year‐old woman with intermittent atrial fibrillation and a recent transient ischaemic attack, do the potential harms and inconvenience of warfarin therapy outweigh the risks of not taking it?') and about a host of other aspects of health and health services.

David Sackett, in the opening editorial of the very first issue of the journal Evidence‐Based Medicine, summarised the essential steps in the emerging science of EBM [2]:

1. To convert our information needs into answerable questions (i.e. to formulate pe problem);
2. To track down, wip maximum efficiency, pe best evidence wip which to answer pese questions – which may come from pe clinical examination, pe diagnostic laboratory, pe published literature or oper sources;
3. To appraise pe evidence critically (i.e. weigh it up) to assess its validity (closeness to pe trup) and usefulness (clinical applicability);
4. To implement pe results of pis appraisal in our clinical practice;
5. To evaluate our performance.

Hence, EBHC requires you not only to read papers, but to read the right papers at the right time and then to alter your behaviour (and, what is often more difficult, influence the behaviour of other people) in the light of what you have found. I am concerned that how‐to‐do‐it courses in EBHC too often concentrate on the third of these five steps (critical appraisal) to the exclusion of all the others. Yet if you have asked the wrong question or sought answers from the wrong sources, you might as well not read any papers at all.

Equally, all your training in search techniques and critical appraisal will go to waste if you do not put at least as much effort into implementing valid evidence and measuring progress towards your goals as you do into reading the paper. A few years ago, I added three more stages to Sackett’s five‐stage model to incorporate the patient’s perspective: the resulting eight stages, which I have called a context‐sensitive checklist for evidence‐based practice, are shown in Appendix 1.

If I were to be pedantic about the title of this book, these broader aspects of EBHC should not even get a mention here. But I hope you would have demanded your money back if I had omitted the final section of this chapter ('Before you start: formulate the problem'), Chapter 2 (Searching the literature) and Chapter 16 (Applying evidence with patients). Chapters 3–15 describe step three of the EBHC process: critical appraisal – that is, what you should do when you actually have the paper in front of you. Chapter 16 deals with common criticisms of EBHC. I have written a separate book on the challenges of implementation, How to Implement Evidence‐Based Healthcare [3].

Incidentally, if you are computer literate and want to explore the subject of EBHC on the Internet, you could try the websites listed in Box 1.1. If you’re not, don’t worry at this stage, but do put learning/use web‐based resources on your to‐do list. Don’t worry either when you discover that there are over 1000 websites dedicated to EBM and EBHC – they all offer very similar material and you certainly don’t need to visit them all.

Why do people sometimes groan when you mention evidence-based healthcare?

Critics of EBHC might define it as ‘the tendency of a group of young, confident and highly numerate medical academics to belittle the performance of experienced clinicians using a combination of epidemiological jargon and statistical sleight-of-hand’ or ‘the argument, usually presented with near-evangelistic zeal, that no health-related action should ever be taken by a doctor, a nurse, a purchaser of health services or a policymaker, unless and until the results of several large and expensive research trials have appeared in print and approved by a committee of experts’.

The resentment amongst some health professionals towards the EBHC movement is mostly a reaction to the implication that doctors (and nurses, midwives, physiotherapists and other health professionals) were functionally illiterate until they were shown the light, and that the few who weren’t illiterate willfully ignored published clinical evidence. Anyone who works face-to-face with patients knows how often it is necessary to seek new information before making a clinical decision. Doctors have spent time in libraries since libraries were invented. In general, we don’t put a patient on a new drug without evidence that it is likely to work. Apart from anything else, such off-license use of medication is, strictly speaking, illegal. Surely we have all been practicing EBHC for years, except when we were deliberately bluffing (using the ‘placebo’ effect for good medical reasons), or when we were ill, overstressed or consciously being lazy?

Well, no, we haven’t. There have been a number of surveys on the behavior of doctors, nurses and related professionals. It was estimated in the 1970s in the USA that only around 10–20% of all health technologies then available (i.e. drugs, procedures, operations, etc.) were evidence-based; that estimate improved to 21% in 1990. Studies of the interventions offered to consecutive series of patients suggested that 60–90% of clinical decisions, depending on the specialty, were ‘evidence-based’ [4]. But such studies had major methodological limitations (in particular, they did not take a particularly nuanced look at whether the patient would have been better off on a different drug or no drug at all). In addition, they were undertaken in specialized units and looked at the practice of world experts in EBHC; hence, the figures arrived at can hardly be generalized beyond their immediate setting (see Chapter 4 ‘Whom is the study about?’). In all probability, we are still selling our patients short most of the time.

A large survey by an Australian team looked at 1000 patients treated for the 22 most commonly seen conditions in a primary care setting. The researchers found that while 90% of patients received evidence-based care for coronary heart disease, only 13% did so for alcohol dependence [5].

Furthermore, the extent to which any individual practitioner provided evidence-based care varied in the sample from 32% of the time to 86% of the time. More recently, a review in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine cited studies of the proportion of doctors’ clinical decisions that were based on strong research evidence; the figure varied from 14% (in thoracic surgery) to 65% (in psychiatry); this paper also reported new data on primary health care, in which around 18% of decisions were based on ‘patient-oriented high-quality evidence’ [6]. Perhaps what is most striking about all these findings is the very wide variation in performance, which ranges from terrible to middling.

Let’s take a look at the various approaches that health professionals use to reach their decisions in reality – all of which are examples of what EBHC isn’t.

Decision-making by anecdote

When I was a medical student, I occasionally joined the retinue of a distinguished professor as he made his daily ward rounds. On seeing a new patient, he would enquire about the patient’s symptoms, turn to the massed ranks of juniors around the bed, and relate the story of a similar patient encountered a few years previously. ‘Ah, yes. I remember we gave her such-and-such, and she was fine after that.’ He was cynical, often rightly, about new drugs and technologies and his clinical acumen was second to none. Nevertheless, it had taken him 40 years to accumulate his expertise, and the largest medical textbook of all – the collection of cases that were outside his personal experience – was forever closed to him.

Anecdote (storytelling) has an important place in clinical practice [7]. Psychologists have shown that students acquire the skills of medicine, nursing and so on by memorising what was wrong with particular patients, and what happened to them, in the form of stories or ‘illness scripts’. Stories about patients are the unit of analysis (i.e. the thing we study) in grand rounds and teaching sessions. Clinicians glean crucial information from patients’ illness narratives – most crucially, perhaps, what being ill means to the patient. And experienced doctors and nurses rightly take account of the accumulated ‘illness scripts’ of all their previous patients when managing subsequent patients. But that doesn’t mean simply doing the same for patient B as you did for patient A if your treatment worked, and doing precisely the opposite if it didn’t!

The dangers of decision-making by anecdote are well illustrated by considering the risk-benefit ratio of drugs and medicines. In my first pregnancy, I developed severe vomiting and was given the anti-sickness drug prochlorperazine (Stemetil). Within minutes, I went into an uncontrollable and very distressing neurological spasm. Two days later, I had recovered fully from

this idiosyncratic reaction, but I have never prescribed the drug since, even though the estimated prevalence of neurological reactions to prochlorperazine is only one in several thousand cases. Conversely, it is tempting to dismiss the possibility of rare but potentially serious adverse effects from familiar drugs – such as thrombosis on the contraceptive pill – when one has never encountered such problems in oneself or one’s patients. We clinicians would not be human if we ignored our personal clinical experiences, but we would be better to base our decisions on the collective experience of thousands of clinicians treating millions of patients, rather than on what we as individuals have seen and felt. Chapter 5 (Statistics for the non‐statistician) describes some more objective methods, such as the number needed to treat (NNT), for deciding whether a particular drug (or other intervention) is likely to do a patient significant good or harm. When the EBM movement was still in its infancy, Sackett emphasised that evidence‐based practice was no threat to old‐fashioned clinical experience or judgement [1]. The question of how clinicians can manage to be both ‘evidence‐based’ (i.e. systematically informing their decisions by research evidence) and ‘narrative‐based’ (i.e. embodying all the richness of their accumulated clinical anecdotes and treating each patient’s problem as a unique illness story rather than as a ‘case of X’) is a difficult one to address philosophically, and beyond the scope of this book. The interested reader might like to look up two articles I’ve written on this topic [8,9].

Decision‐making by press cutting

For the first 10 years after I qualified, I kept an expanding file of papers that I had ripped out of my medical weeklies before binning the less interesting parts. If an article or editorial seemed to have something new to say, I consciously altered my clinical practice in line with its conclusions. All children with suspected urinary tract infections should be sent for scans of the kidneys to exclude congenital abnormalities, said one article, so I began referring anyone under the age of 16 with urinary symptoms for specialist investigations. The advice was in print, and it was recent, so it must surely replace what had been standard practice – in this case, referring only the small minority of such children who display ‘atypical’ features. This approach to clinical decision‐making is still very common. How many clinicians do you know who justify their approach to a particular clinical problem by citing the results section of a single published study, even though they could not tell you anything at all about the methods used to obtain those results? Was the trial randomised and controlled (see Chapter 3 ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’)? How many patients, of what age, sex and disease severity, were involved (see Chapter 4 ‘Whom is the study about’)? How many withdrew from (‘dropped out of ’) the study, and why (see Chapter 4

'Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?' By what criteria were patients judged cured (see Chapter 6 'Surrogate endpoints')? If the findings of the study appeared to contradict those of other researchers, what attempt was made to validate (confirm) and replicate (repeat) them (see Chapter 8 'Ten questions to ask about a paper that claims to validate a diagnostic or screening test')? Were the statistical tests that allegedly proved the authors' point appropriately chosen and correctly performed (see Chapter 5)? Has the patient's perspective been systematically sought and incorporated via a shared decision-making tool (see Chapter 16)? Doctors (and nurses, midwives, medical managers, psychologists, medical students and consumer activists) who like to cite the results of medical research studies have a responsibility to ensure that they first go through a checklist of questions like these (more of which are listed in Appendix 1).

# Decision-making by GOBSAT (good old boys sat around a table)

When I wrote the first edition of this book in the mid-1990s, the most common sort of guideline was what was known as a consensus statement – the fruits of a weekend's hard work by a dozen or so eminent experts who had been shut in a luxury hotel, usually at the expense of a drug company. Such 'GOBSAT (good old boys sat around a table) guidelines' often fell out of the medical freebies (free medical journals and other 'information sheets' sponsored directly or indirectly by the pharmaceutical industry) as pocket-sized booklets replete with potted recommendations and at-a-glance management guides. But who says the advice given in a set of guidelines, a punchy editorial or an amply referenced overview is correct?

Cindy Mulrow [10], one of the founders of the science of systematic review (see Chapter 9), showed a few years ago that experts in a particular clinical field are less likely to provide an objective review of all the available evidence than a non-expert who approaches the literature with unbiased eyes. In extreme cases, an 'expert opinion' may consist simply of the lifelong bad habits and personal press cuttings of an ageing clinician, and a gaggle of such experts would simply multiply the misguided views of any one of them. Table 1.1 gives examples of practices that were at one time widely accepted as good clinical practice (and which would have made it into the GOBSAT guideline of the day), but which have subsequently been discredited by high-quality clinical trials. Indeed, one growth area in EBHC is using evidence to inform disinvestment in practices that were once believed to be evidence-based [11].

Chapter 9 takes you through a checklist for assessing whether a 'systematic review of the evidence' produced to support recommendations for practice or policymaking really merits the description, and Chapter 10 discusses the harm that can be done by applying guidelines that are not evidence-based.

Interestingly, blood‐letting was probably the first practice for which a randomised controlled trial was suggested. The physician van Helmont issued this challenge to his colleagues as early as 1662: ‘Let us take 200 or 500 poor people that have fevers. Let us cast lots, that one half of them may fall to my share, and the others to yours. I will cure them without blood‐letting, but you do as you know – and we shall see how many funerals both of us shall have’ [12]. I am grateful to Matthias Egger for drawing my attention to this example.

It is a major achievement of the EBHC movement that almost no guideline these days is produced by GOBSAT!

Decision-making by cost-minimisation

The popular press tends to be horrified when they learn that a treatment has been withheld from a patient for reasons of cost. Managers, politicians and, increasingly, doctors can count on being pilloried when a child with a rare cancer is not sent to a specialist unit in the USA or an elderly patient is denied a drug to stop her visual loss from macular degeneration. Yet, in the real world, all healthcare is provided from a limited budget and it is increasingly recognised that clinical decisions must take into account the economic costs of a given intervention. As Chapter 11 argues, clinical decision-making purely on the grounds of cost ('cost-minimisation' - purchasing the cheapest option with no regard to how effective it is) is generally ethically unjustified, and we are right to object vocally when this occurs.

Expensive interventions should not, however, be justified simply because they are new, or because they ought to work in theory or because the only alternative is to do nothing - but because they are very likely to save life or significantly improve its quality. How, though, can the benefits of a hip replacement in a 75-year-old be meaningfully compared with that of cholesterol-lowering drugs in a middle-aged man or infertility investigations for a couple in their twenties? Somewhat counter-intuitively, there is no self-evident set of ethical principles or analytical tools that we can use to match limited resources to unlimited demand. As you will see in Chapter 11, the much-derided quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and similar utility-based units are simply attempts to lend some objectivity to the illogical but unavoidable comparison of apples with oranges in the field of human suffering. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (see www.nice.org.uk) seeks to develop both evidence-based guidelines and fair allocation of NHS resources.

There is one more reason why some people find the term evidence-based medicine (or healthcare) unpalatable. This chapter has argued that EBHC is about coping with change, not about knowing all the answers before you start. In other words, it is not so much about what you have read in the past but about how you go about identifying and meeting your ongoing learning needs and applying your knowledge appropriately and consistently in new clinical situations. Doctors who were brought up in the old school style of never admitting ignorance may find it hard to accept that a major element of scientific uncertainty exists in practically every clinical encounter, although in most cases, the clinician fails to identify the uncertainty or to articulate it in terms of an answerable question (see section 'Before you start: formulate the problem'). If you are interested in the research evidence on doctors' (lack of) questioning behaviour, see an excellent review by Swinglehurst [13].

Chapter 1

The fact that none of us – not even the cleverest or most experienced – can answer all the questions that arise in the average clinical encounter means that the ‘expert’ is more fallible than he or she was traditionally cracked up to be. An evidence‐based approach to ward rounds may turn the traditional medical hierarchy on its head when the staff nurse or junior doctor produces new evidence that challenges what the consultant taught everyone last week. For some senior clinicians, learning the skills of critical appraisal is the least of their problems in adjusting to an evidence‐based teaching style!

Having defended EBHC against all the standard arguments put forward by clinicians, I should confess to being sympathetic to many of the more sophisticated arguments put forward by philosophers and social scientists. Such arguments, summarised in Chapter 17, address the nature of knowledge and the question of how much medicine really rests on decisions at all. But please don’t turn to that chapter (which is, philosophically speaking, a ‘hard read’) until you have fully grasped the basic arguments in the first few chapters of this book – or you risk becoming confused!

# Before you start: formulate the problem

When I ask my medical students to write me an essay about high blood pressure, they often produce long, scholarly and essentially correct statements on what high blood pressure is, what causes it and what the different treatment options are. On the day they hand their essays in, most of them know far more about high blood pressure than I do. They are certainly aware that high blood pressure is the single most common cause of stroke, and that detecting and treating everyone’s high blood pressure would cut the incidence of stroke by almost half. Most of them are aware that stroke, although devastating when it happens, is a fairly rare event, and that blood pressure tablets have side effects such as tiredness, dizziness, impotence and getting ‘caught short’ when a long way from the lavatory.

But when I ask my students a practical question such as ‘Mrs Jones has developed light‐headedness on these blood pressure tablets and she wants to stop all medication; what would you advise her to do?’, they are often foxed. They sympathise with Mrs Jones’ predicament, but they cannot distil from their pages of close‐written text the one thing that Mrs Jones needs to know. As Smith (paraphrasing T.S. Eliot) asked a few years ago in a BMJ editorial: ‘Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge, and the knowledge we have lost in information?’[14].

Experienced clinicians might think they can answer Mrs Jones’ question from their own personal experience. As I argued in the previous section, few of them would be right. And even if they were right on this occasion, they would still need an overall system for converting the rag‐bag of information

# Chapter 1

How to read a paper

About a patient (an ill‐defined set of symptoms, physical signs, test results and knowledge of what happened to this patient or a similar patient last time), the particular values and preferences (utilities) of the patient and other things that could be relevant (a hunch, a half‐remembered article, the opinion of a more experienced colleague or a paragraph discovered by chance while flicking through a textbook) into a succinct summary of what the problem is and what specific additional items of information we need to solve that problem.

Sackett and colleagues, in a book subsequently revised by Straus [15], have helped us by dissecting the parts of a good clinical question:

- First, define precisely whom the question is about (i.e. ask ‘How would I describe a group of patients similar to this one?’).
- Next, define which manoeuvre you are considering in this patient or population (e.g. a drug treatment), and, if necessary, a comparison manoeuvre (e.g. placebo or current standard therapy).
- Finally, define the desired (or undesired) outcome (e.g. reduced mortality, better quality of life, and overall cost savings to the health service).

The second step may not concern a drug treatment, surgical operation or other intervention. The manoeuvre could, for example, be the exposure to a putative carcinogen (something that might cause cancer) or the detection of a particular surrogate endpoint in a blood test or other investigation. (A surrogate endpoint, as Chapter 6 ‘Surrogate endpoints’ explains, is something that predicts, or is said to predict, the later development or progression of disease. In reality, there are very few tests that reliably act as crystal balls for patients’ medical future. The statement ‘The doctor looked at the test results and told me I had six months to live’ usually reflects either poor memory or irresponsible doctoring!) In both these cases, the ‘outcome’ would be the development of cancer (or some other disease) several years later. In most clinical problems with individual patients, however, the ‘manoeuvre’ consists of a specific intervention initiated by a health professional.

Thus, in Mrs Jones’ case, we might ask, ‘In a 68‐year‐old white woman with essential (i.e. common or garden) hypertension (high blood pressure), no coexisting illness and no significant past medical history, whose blood pressure is currently X/Y, do the benefits of continuing therapy with bendroflumethiazide (chiefly, reduced risk of stroke) outweigh the inconvenience?’ Note that in framing the specific question, we have already established that Mrs Jones has never had a heart attack, stroke or early warning signs such as transient paralysis or loss of vision. If she had, her risk of subsequent stroke would be much higher and we would, rightly, load the risk–benefit equation to reflect this.

Chapter 1

In order to answer the question we have posed, we must determine not just the risk of stroke in untreated hypertension, but also the likely reduction in that risk which we can expect with drug treatment. This is, in fact, a rephrasing of a more general question (do the benefits of treatment in this case outweigh the risks?) which we should have asked before we prescribed bendroflumethiazide to Mrs Jones in the first place, and which all doctors should, of course, ask themselves every time they reach for their prescription pad.

Remember that Mrs Jones’ alternative to staying on this particular drug is not necessarily to take no drugs at all; there may be other drugs with equivalent efficacy but less disabling side effects (as Chapter 6 argues, too many clinical trials of new drugs compare the product with placebo rather than with the best available alternative), or non-medical treatments such as exercise, salt restriction, homeopathy or yoga. Not all of these approaches would help Mrs Jones or be acceptable to her, but it would be quite appropriate to seek evidence as to whether they might help her – especially if she was asking to try one or more of these remedies.

We will probably find answers to some of these questions in the medical literature, and Chapter 2 describes how to search for relevant papers once you have formulated the problem. But before you start, give one last thought to your patient with high blood pressure. In order to determine her personal priorities (how does she value a 10% reduction in her risk of stroke in 5 years’ time compared to the inability to go shopping unaccompanied today?), you will need to approach Mrs Jones, not a blood pressure specialist or the Medline database! Chapter 16 sets out some structured approaches for doing this.

# Chapter 2 Searching the literature

Evidence is accumulating faster than ever before, and staying up-to-date is essential to ensure the best patient care. Studies and reviews of studies of clinicians’ information-seeking behaviour confirm that textbooks and personal contacts continue to be the most favoured sources for clinical information, followed by journal articles (see, e.g. Davies [1]). Use of the Internet as an information resource has increased dramatically in recent years, especially via PubMed/Medline, but the sophistication of searching and the efficiency in finding answers has not grown apace. Ask any medical librarian and you will hear tales of important clinical questions being addressed using unsystematic Google searches. While the need of healthcare professionals for information of the best quality has never been greater, barriers abound: lack of time, lack of facilities, lack of searching skills, lack of motivation and (perhaps worst of all) information overload [2].

The medical literature is far more of a jungle today than it was when the first edition of this book was published in 1996. The volume and complexity of published literature has grown: Medline alone has over 20 million references. While Medline is the flagship database for journal articles in the health sciences, it is a very conservative resource, slow to pick up new journals or journals published outside the USA, so there are many thousands of high-quality papers that may be available via other databases but are not on Medline. The proliferation of databases makes the information jungle that much more confusing, especially because each database covers its own range of journals and each has its own particular search protocols. How will you cope?

There is hope: in the past few years, the information ‘jungle’ has been tamed by means of information highways and high-speed transit systems. Knowing how to access these navigational wonders will save you time and improve your ability to find the best evidence. The purpose of this chapter is

# Searching the literature

not to teach you to become an expert searcher, but rather to help you recognise the kinds of resources that are available, choose intelligently among them and put them to work directly.

# Chapter 2

What are you looking for?

A searcher approaches medical (and, more broadly, health science) literature for three broad purposes:

1. Informally, almost recreationally, browsing to keep current and to satisfy our intrinsic curiosity.
2. Focused, looking for answers, perhaps related to questions that have occurred in clinic or that arise from individual patients and their questions.
3. Surveying the existing literature, perhaps before embarking on a research project.

Each approach involves searching in a very different way.

Browsing has an element of serendipity about it. In the old days, we would pick up our favourite journal and follow where our fancy took us. And if our fancy was informed with a few tools to help us discriminate the quality of papers we found, so much the better. These days, we can make use of new tools to help us with our browsing. We can browse electronic journals just as easily as paper journals; we can use alerting services to let us know when a new issue has been published and even tell us if articles matching our interest profile are in that issue. We can have Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds of articles from particular journals or on particular topics sent to our e‐mail addresses or our iPhones or personal blogs, and we can participate in Twitter exchanges related to newly published papers. Almost every journal has links from its home page allowing at least one of these social networking services. These technologies are changing continuously. Those of us who have been faced with deluges of new offprints, photocopies and journal issues we have been meaning to read will be happy to learn that we can create the same chaos electronically. That is what browsing serendipitously is all about, and it is a joy we should never lose, in whatever medium our literature may be published.

Looking for answers implies a much more focused approach, a search for an answer we can trust to apply directly to the care of a patient. When we find that trustworthy information, it is OK to stop looking – we don’t need to beat the bush for absolutely every study that may have addressed this topic. This kind of query is increasingly well served by new synthesised information sources whose goal is to support evidence‐based care and the transfer of research findings into practice. This is discussed further later.

# Chapter 2

How to read a paper

Surveying the literature – preparing a detailed, broad‐based and thoughtful literature review, for example, when writing an essay for an assignment or an article for publication – involves an entirely different process. The purpose here is less to influence patient care directly than to identify the existing body of research that has addressed a problem and clarify the gaps in knowledge that require further research. For this kind of searching, a strong knowledge of information resources and skill in searching them are fundamental. A simple PubMed search will not suffice. Multiple relevant databases need to be searched systematically, and citation chaining (see subsequent text) needs to be employed to assure that no stone has been left unturned. If this is your goal, you must consult with an information professional (health librarian, clinical informaticist, etc.).

Levels upon levels of evidence

The term level of evidence refers to what degree that information can be trusted, based on study design. Traditionally, and considering the most common type of question (relating to therapy), levels of evidence are represented as a pyramid with systematic reviews positioned grandly at the top, followed by well‐designed randomised controlled trials, then observational studies such as cohort studies or case–control studies, with case studies, bench (laboratory) studies and ‘expert opinion’ somewhere near the bottom (Figure 2.1). All this is described in more detail later in this book.

# Chapter 2

My librarian colleagues, who are often keen on synthesised evidence and technical resources for decision support, remind me of a rival pyramid, with computerised decision support systems (abbreviated ‘systems’) at the top, above evidence-based practice guidelines, followed by systematic review synopses, with standard systematic reviews beneath these, and so on [3]. Whether we think in terms of the first (traditional) evidence pyramid or the second (more contemporary) one, the message is clear: all evidence, all information, is not necessarily equivalent. We need to keep a sharp eye out for the believability of whatever information we find, wherever we find it.

# Synthesised sources: systems, summaries and syntheses

Information resources synthesised from primary studies constitute a very high level of evidence indeed. These resources exist to help translate research into practice and inform clinician and patient decision-making. This kind of evidence is relatively new (at least, compared to traditional primary research studies, which have been with us for centuries), but their use is expected to grow considerably as they become better known.

Systematic reviews are perhaps the oldest and best known of the synthesised sources, having started in the 1980s under the inspiration of Archie Cochrane, who bemoaned the multiplicity of individual clinical trials whose information failed to provide clear messages for practice. The original efforts to search broadly for clinical trials on a topic and pool their results statistically grew into the Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com) in the mid-1990s; Cochrane Reviews became the gold standard for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Collaboration the premier force for developing and improving review methodology [4].

There are many advantages to systematic reviews and a few cautions. On the plus side, systematic reviews are relatively easy to interpret. The systematic selection and appraisal of the primary studies according to an approved protocol means that bias is minimised. Smaller studies, which are all too common in some topic areas, may show a trend towards positive impact but lack statistical significance. But when data from several small studies are summed mathematically in a process called meta-analysis, the combined data may produce a statistically significant finding (see Chapter 9 ‘Meta-analysis for the non-statistician’). Systematic reviews can help resolve contradictory findings among different studies on the same question. If the systematic review has been properly conducted, the results are likely to be robust and generalisable. On the negative side, systematic reviews can replicate and magnify flaws in the original studies (e.g. if all the primary studies considered a drug at sub-therapeutic dose, the overall – misleading – conclusion may be that the drug has ‘no effect’). Cochrane Reviews can be a daunting read, but
---
# Chapter 2

How to read a paper

Here’s a tip. The bulk of a Cochrane Review consists of methodological discussion: the gist of it can be gleaned by jumping to the ‘Plain Language Summary’, always to be found directly following the abstract. Alternatively, you can gain a quick and accurate summary by looking at the pictures – especially something called a forest plot, which graphically displays the results of each of the primary studies along with the combined result. Chapter 9 explains systematic reviews in more detail.

Cochrane Reviews are only published electronically, but other systematic reviews appear throughout the clinical literature. They are most easily accessed via the Cochrane Library, which publishes Cochrane Reviews, DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, listed in Cochrane Library as ‘Other reviews’), and a database of Health Technology Assessments (HTAs). DARE provides not only a bibliography of systematic reviews, but also a critical appraisal of most of the reviews included, making this a ‘pre‐appraised source’ for systematic reviews. HTAs are essentially systematic reviews but range further to consider economic and policy implications of drugs, technologies and health systems. All can be searched relatively simply and simultaneously via the Cochrane Library.

In the past, Cochrane Reviews focused mainly on questions of therapy (see Chapter 6) or prevention, but since 2008 considerable effort has gone into producing systematic reviews of diagnostic tests (see Chapter 8).

Point‐of‐care resources are rather like electronic textbooks or detailed clinical handbooks, but explicitly evidence‐based, continuously updated and designed to be user‐friendly – perhaps the textbook of the future. Three popular ones are BMJ Best Practice, DynaMed and Essential Evidence Plus. All of these aspire to be firmly evidence‐based, peer‐reviewed, revised regularly and with links to the primary research incorporated into their recommendations.

|BMJ Best Practice|https://bestpractice.bmj.com/info/evidence‐information/|a British resource (for which a subscription is required), draws on systematic reviews to provide very quick information, especially on the comparative value of tests and interventions. Reviews are organised into sections, such as Child Health or Skin Disorders; or you can search the database by keyword (e.g. ‘asthma’) or by a full review list. In each clinical area, there are sections for doctors, nurses, pharmacists and patients.|
|---|---|---|
|DynaMed|https://dynamed.com/home/|produced in the USA, is rather more like a handbook with chapters covering a wide variety of disorders, but with summaries of clinical research, levels of evidence and links to the|

primary articles. It covers causes and risks, complications and associated conditions (including differential diagnosis), what to look for in the history and physical examination, what diagnostic tests to do, prognosis, treatment, prevention and screening and links to patient information handouts. You can search very simply for the condition: the results include links to other chapters about similar conditions. This is a proprietary resource (i.e. you generally have to pay for it), although it may be provided free to those who offer to write a chapter themselves!

Chapter 2

- Essential Evidence Plus (http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/) is another subscription-only US-based resource put together by EBM-savvy doctors and aimed at the busy front-line clinician. It includes a searchable database of clinical topics and a daily POEM ('patient oriented evidence that matters'). Check to see if your organisation has institutional membership!

All the above resources have applications (apps) that allow use on smartphones, which improve their bedside usability for patient care. New point‐of‐care resources are continually emerging, so it is very much a matter of individual preference which you use. The three listed were chosen because they are peer‐reviewed, regularly updated and directly linked to the primary evidence.

Practice Guidelines, covered in detail in Chapter 10, are 'systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare for specific clinical circumstances' [5]. In a good guideline, the scientific evidence is assembled systematically, the panel developing the guideline includes representatives from all relevant disciplines, including patients, and the recommendations are explicitly linked to the evidence from which they are derived [6]. Guidelines are a summarised form of evidence, very high on the hierarchy of pre‐appraised resources, but the initial purpose of the guideline should always be kept in mind: guidelines for different settings and different purposes can be based on the same evidence but come out with different recommendations.

Guidelines are readily available from a variety of sources, including the following.

- National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, www.nice.org.uk) is a UK‐government‐funded agency responsible for developing evidence‐based guidelines and other evidence summaries to support national health policy. NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries (https://cks.nice.org.uk), based closely on NICE guidelines, are designed especially for those working in primary health care.

# Chapter 2

How to read a paper

National Guideline Clearinghouse (https://www.ahrq.gov/gam/index.html) is an initiative of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services. Although a government-funded US database, National Geographic Channel (NGC) is international in content. An advantage of this resource is that different guidelines purporting to cover the same topic can be directly compared on all points, from levels of evidence to recommendations. All guidelines must be current and revised every 5 years, although at the time of writing the AHRQ has lost federal funding and is no longer updating the guideline site.

A straightforward and popular way to search practice guidelines is via TRIP (Turning Research into Practice, www.tripdatabase.com), a federated search engine discussed later in this chapter. For guidelines, look in the box panel to the right of the screen following a simple search on TRIP: a heading ‘guidelines’ appears, with subheadings for Australian and New Zealand, Canadian, UK, USA and Other, and a number indicting the number of guidelines found on that topic. NICE and National Guideline Clearinghouse are included among the guidelines searched.

Pre-appraised sources: synopses of systematic reviews and primary studies

If your topic is more circumscribed than those covered in the synthesised or summary sources listed, or if you are simply browsing to keep current with the literature, consider one of the pre-appraised sources as a means of navigating through those millions of articles in our information jungle. The most common format is the digest of clinical research articles gleaned from core journals and deemed to provide important information for patient care: Evidence-Based Medicine, ACP Journal Club, Evidence-Based Mental Health and POEMS (Patient-Oriented Evidence that Matters). Some are free, some are available through institutions or memberships or private subscription. All of them have a format that includes a structured abstract and a brief critical appraisal of the article’s content. Studies included may be single studies or systematic reviews. Each is considered a pre-appraised source, and critical appraisal aside, simple inclusion has implications for the perceived quality and importance of the original article.

All of these sources can be considered as small databases of select studies, which can be searched by keyword. Other selected journal article services, such as Evidence Updates, provide abstracts plus an indication of level of interest each article might hold for particular disciplines.
---
# Searching the literature

DARE was mentioned as a pre‐appraised source for systematic reviews other than Cochrane Reviews, in that it provides an augmented abstract and a brief critical appraisal for most systematic reviews in its database.

Another source that is considered pre‐appraised, although it contains no appraisals, is the Central Register of Controlled Trials, also part of the Cochrane Library. ‘Central’ is a bibliography of studies included in Cochrane Reviews, as well as in new studies on similar topics, maintained by the various Cochrane Review Groups. DARE, Central, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the HTA database and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database – which also includes critically appraised summaries of studies – can be searched simultaneously in the Cochrane Library.

# Specialised resources

Specialised information sources, organised (as the name implies) to assist the specialist doctor in a particular field, are often also useful for generalists, specialist nurses and primary care clinicians. Most professional associations maintain excellent websites with practice guidelines, journal links and other useful information resources; most require membership in the association to access educational and practice materials. Two notable examples that are available for a fee are Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) and Psychiatry Online.

|GIDEON|Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network, www.gideononline.com|an evidence‐based programme that assists with diagnosis and treatment of communicable diseases. In addition, GIDEON tracks incidence and prevalence of diseases worldwide and includes the spectrum covered by antibiotic agents.|
|---|---|---|
|Psychiatry Online|https://psychiatryonline.org|a compendium of core textbooks (including Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM‐5)), psychiatry journals and practice guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association, produced by the American Psychiatric Press.|

These two are only examples. Whatever your specialty (or specialist topic), there will usually be a similar resource maintained by a professional society. Ask a librarian or clinical informaticist to help you find the relevant one.

# Primary studies – tackling the jungle

Whether through habit or through lack of familiarity with all the useful synthesised, summarised or pre‐appraised sources described earlier, most health practitioners still prefer a basic search of Medline/PubMed to answer

their clinical information needs. Some simply prefer to assess the primary literature for themselves, without thumbnail critical appraisals or incorporation into larger disease management chapters. Primary sources can be found in a variety of ways. You could look at the reference lists and hyperlinks from the secondary sources described. You could identify them from journals – for example, via RSS feeds, table-of-contents services or more focused topical information services. And you could search databases such as PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PASCAL, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (Cumulated Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Biosis Previews, Web of Science, Scopus or Google or Google Scholar. Let’s consider these in turn.

PubMed is the most frequently accessed Internet resource for most physicians and health professionals worldwide, probably because it is free and well-known (just put ‘PubMed’ into Google and you will find it easily). Most people opt for the basic PubMed search, using two or three search text words at best – and characteristically turning up hundreds or thousands of references, of which they look at only the first couple of screens. This is certainly not the most efficient way to search, but it is the reality of how most people do search [7]. Interestingly, when just one or two more search terms are added, the efficiency of a basic PubMed search improves substantially [7]. Simple tools that are part of the Medline search engine can be used to help focus a search and produce better results for a basic search, but they are rarely used by medical students or doctors. One such tool is the ‘limit’ function, allowing restrictions to such generic topics as gender, age group or study design; to language; or to core clinical journals. The advanced search function on PubMed incorporates these limits into a single search page. Next time you are on the PubMed website with some time to spare, play with these tools and see how easily they can sharpen your search.

‘Clinical queries’, an option provided in the left-hand panel of the basic PubMed screen or at the bottom of the advanced search screen, superimposes on the search a filter based on optimum study designs for best evidence, depending on the domain of the question and the degree to which one wishes to focus the question. For example, if you were searching for a therapy study for hypercholesterolaemia, the clinical query for therapy/narrow and specific would be rendered as ‘(hypercholesterolaemia) AND (randomised controlled trial [Publication Type] OR (randomised [Title/Abstract] AND controlled [Title/Abstract] AND trial [Title/Abstract]))’. In this instance, the search might need further limits or perhaps the addition of a second term, such as a specific drug, because the result is over 2000 postings.

Citation chaining (or, to use its alternative term, citation tracking) provides another means of following a topic. Let’s say that following your interest in

# Searching the literature

hypercholesterolaemia, you wish to follow up a classic primary research study, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, originally published in the 1990s [8]. In your PubMed search, you found a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2007 that described a 10‐year follow‐up [9], but you now wonder if there has been anything further. The databases Web of Science, comprising Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index online, provide a cited reference search feature. Entering the author’s name (in this case I. Ford) and the year of publication (2007), we can trace the specific article, and find that several hundred articles published since have cited it in their reference lists, including at least one 20‐year follow‐up study [10]. Citation searching can give a crude indication of the relative importance of a study, based on the number of times it has been cited (bearing in mind that one sometimes cites a paper when emphasising how bad it is!). A very simple (but somewhat less accurate) way of citation chaining is to use Google Scholar: simply put the article’s title into this search engine and when you have found it, select ‘citations’.

Google Scholar, a very broad‐based web browser, is increasingly popular and extremely handy, accessible as it is from the Google toolbar. For an obscure topic, Google Scholar can be an excellent resource on which to fall back, as it will identify papers that are listed on PubMed as well as those that aren’t. Unfortunately, there are no quality filters (such as clinical queries), no limits (such as gender or age), so a search on a widely researched topic will tend to turn up a long list of hits that you have no alternative but to wade through.

# One‐stop shopping: federated search engines

Perhaps the simplest and most efficient answer for most clinicians searching for information for patient care is a federated search engine such as TRIP, (www.tripdatabase.com), which searches multiple resources simultaneously and has the advantage of being free.

TRIP has a truly primitive search engine, but it searches synthesised sources (systematic reviews including Cochrane Reviews), summarised sources (including practice guidelines from North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand and elsewhere, as well as electronic textbooks) and pre‐appraised sources (such as the journals Evidence‐Based Medicine and Evidence‐Based Mental Health), as well as searching all clinical query domains in PubMed simultaneously. Moreover, searches can be limited by discipline, such as Paediatrics or Surgery, helping to focus a search and eliminate clearly irrelevant results and acknowledging the tendency of medical specialists to (rightly or wrongly) prefer the literature in their own journals. Given that most clinicians favour very simple searches, a TRIP search may well get you the maximum bang for your buck.

Asking for help and asking around

If a librarian fractured his or her wrist, he or she would have no hesitation in seeking out a physician. Similarly, a healthcare professional doesn’t need to cope with the literature alone. Health librarians are readily available in universities, hospitals, government departments and agencies and professional societies. They know the databases available, they know the complexities of searching, they know the literature (even complex government documents and obscure datasets) and they usually know just enough about the topic to have an idea of what you are looking for and levels of evidence that are likely to be found. When one librarian can’t find an answer, there are colleagues with whom he or she can and will consult, locally, nationally and internationally. Librarians of the 21st century are exceptionally well networked!

Asking people you know yourself or know about has its advantages. Experts in the field are often aware of unpublished research or reports commissioned by government or other agencies – notoriously hard-to-find ‘grey’ or ‘fugitive’ literature that is not indexed in any source. An international organised information-sharing organisation CHAIN (Contact, Help, Advice and Information Network, www.chain-network.org.uk) provides a useful online network for people working in health and social care who wish to share information. CHAIN is free to join and, once a member, you can pitch in a question and target it to a designated group of specialists.

In a field as overwhelming and complex as health information, asking colleagues and people you trust has always been a preferred source for information. In the early days of evidence-based medicine (EBM), asking around was seen as unsystematic and ‘biased’. It remains true that asking around is insufficient for a search for evidence, but in the light of the ability of experts to locate obscure literature, can any search really be considered complete without it?

Online tutorials for effective searching

Many universities and other educational institutions now provide self-study tutorials, which you can access via computer – either on an intranet (for members of the university only) or the Internet (accessible to everyone). Here are some I found when revising this chapter for the fifth edition. Note that as with all Internet-based sources, some sites will move or close down, so I apologise in advance if you find a dead link:

There are many other similar tutorials accessible free on the Internet, but few of them cover much beyond searching for primary studies and systematic reviews in PubMed and the Cochrane Library.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. If you were a busy geriatrician and keen to stay updated on the latest developments in your specialty, which sources of evidence would you use? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of each of them?
2. Explore the TRIP database (www.tripdatabase.com or put ‘Trip Database’ into Google) as an example of a powerful federated search engine. Put a term into the search box (for example,‘gestational diabetes’) and hit the search button. Now look down the right‐hand column and see what the site offers you in terms of systematic reviews, evidence‐based synopses, guidelines and key primary research.
3. Explore the Cochrane Library and find a Cochrane Review on a topic of your choice. The easiest way to get there is put ‘Cochrane Library’ into Google. On the home page, you can browse by broad category of topic, or you can use the search engine to look for more specific topics. Skim through an entire review (they’re often very long) to get a feel for how these reviews are structured. Many of the recent ones have useful patient (lay) summaries which are short and relatively jargon‐free.

# Chapter 3 Getting your bearings: what is this paper about?

The science of ‘trashing’ papers

It usually comes as a surprise to students to learn that some published articles, the purists would say up to 99%, belong in the bin, and should certainly not be used to inform practice. In 1979, Stephen Lock, the editor of the British Medical Journal, wrote ‘Few things are more dispiriting to a medical editor than having to reject a paper based on a good idea but with irremediable flaws in the methods used.’ Fifteen years later, Altman was still claiming that only 1% of medical research was free of methodological flaws [1], and in 2005 John Ioannidis published his classic paper, ‘Why most published research findings are false’ [2]. Box 3.1 shows the main flaws that lead to papers being rejected, and which are present to some degree in many that are published.

Most papers appearing in medical journals are presented more or less in standard format: introduction, methods, research and discussion (IMRAD). Introduction (why the authors decided to do this particular piece of research); methods (how they did it, and how they chose to analyse their results); results (what they found); and discussion (what they think the results mean). If you are deciding whether a paper is worth reading, you should do so on the design of the methods section, and not on the interest value of the hypothesis, the nature or potential impact of the results or the speculation in the discussion.

Conversely, bad science is bad science regardless of whether the study addressed an important clinical issue, whether the results are ‘statistically significant’, whether things changed in the direction you would have liked them to and whether the findings promise immeasurable benefits for patients or savings for the health service. Strictly speaking, if you are going to trash a paper, you should do so before you even look at the results.

It is much easier to pick holes in other people’s work than to carry out a methodologically perfect piece of research oneself. When I teach critical appraisal, there is usually someone in the group who finds it profoundly discourteous to criticise research projects into which dedicated scientists have put the best years of their lives. I remind these students that scholarly critique is not the same as gratuitous criticism. There may also be good practical reasons why the authors of the study have not performed a perfect study, and they know as well as you do that their work would have been more scientifically valid if this or that (anticipated or unanticipated) difficulty had not arisen during the course of the study.

Most good scientific journals send papers out to a referee for comments on their scientific validity, originality and importance before deciding whether to publish them. This process is known as peer review, and much has been written about it [3]. Common defects picked up by referees are listed in Box 3.1.

The assessment of methodological quality (critical appraisal) has been covered in detail in the widely cited series ‘Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature’ originally published in the Journal of the American Medical

Association (universally known as JAMA). JAMA’s structured guides on how
to read papers on therapy, diagnosis, screening, prognosis, causation, quality
of care, economic analysis, systematic review, qualitative research and so on
are regarded by many as the definitive checklists for critical appraisal.
Appendix 1 lists some simpler checklists I have derived from the Users’ Chapter 3
Guides and the other sources cited at the end of this chapter, together with
some ideas of my own. If you are an experienced journal reader, these checklists will be largely self‐explanatory. But if you still have difficulty getting
started when looking at a medical paper, try asking the preliminary questions
in the next section.

# Three preliminary questions to get your bearings

Question One: Why was the study needed – and what
was the research question?

The introductory sentence of a research paper should state, in a nutshell,
what the background to the research is. For example, ‘Grommet insertion is
a common procedure in children with glue ear, and it has been suggested
that not all operations are clinically necessary, since most children grow out
of the problem without surgical treatment.’ This statement should be
followed by a brief review of the published literature, for example, ‘Gupta and
Brown’s prospective survey of grommet insertions demonstrated that…’ . It is
irritatingly common for authors to forget to place their research in context,
as the background to the problem is usually clear as daylight to them by the
time they reach the writing‐up stage. Be warned – the authors may selectively
cite only some papers and even misrepresent what those studies found in
order to justify their own research. If in doubt, do a literature search yourself
(see Chapter 2).

The last sentence of the introduction (or occasionally somewhere early in
the methods section) should state clearly the research question and/or the
hypothesis that the authors have decided to test. For example: ‘This study
aimed to determine whether insertion of grommets was more effective and
safer than watchful waiting.’

You may find that the research question has inadvertently been omitted,
or, more commonly, that the information is buried somewhere mid‐
paragraph. If the main research hypothesis is presented in the negative
(which it usually is), such as ‘The addition of metformin to maximal dose
sulphonylurea therapy will not improve the control of type 2 diabetes’, it is
known as a null hypothesis. The authors of a study rarely actually believe their
null hypothesis when they embark on their research. Being human, they have
usually set out to demonstrate a difference between the two arms of their
study. But the way scientists do this is to say ‘let’s assume there’s no difference;
---
# Chapter 3

How to read a paper

Now let’s try to disprove that theory’. If you adhere to the teachings of philosopher of science Karl Popper, this hypotheticodeductive approach (setting up falsifiable hypotheses that you then proceed to test) is the very essence of the scientific method [4]. If you have not discovered what the authors’ research question was by the time you are halfway through the methods section, you may find it in the first paragraph of the discussion. Remember, however, that not all research studies (even good ones) are set up to test a single definitive hypothesis. Qualitative research studies, which (so long as they are well‐designed and well‐conducted) are as valid and as necessary as the more conventional quantitative studies, aim to look at particular issues in a broad, open‐ended way in order to illuminate issues; generate or modify hypotheses and prioritize areas to investigate. This type of research is discussed further in Chapter 12. Even quantitative research (which most of the rest of this book is about) is now seen as more than hypothesis‐testing. In general, it is preferable to talk about evaluating the strength of evidence around a particular issue than about proving or disproving hypotheses.

Question Two: What was the research design?

First, decide whether the paper describes a primary or secondary study. Primary studies report research first‐hand, while secondary studies attempt to summarize and draw conclusions from primary studies. Primary studies (sometimes known as empirical studies) are the stuff of most published research in medical journals, and usually fall into one of these categories:

- Laboratory experiments, in which a maneuver is performed on an animal or a volunteer in artificial and controlled surroundings.
- Comparative clinical trials, a form of experiment in which an intervention – either simple (such as a drug; see Chapter 6) or complex (such as an educational program; see Chapter 7) – is offered to a group of participants (i.e. the patients included in the trial) who are then followed up to see what happens to them.
- Surveys, in which something is measured in a group of participants (patients, health professionals or some other sample of individuals). Questionnaire surveys (see Chapter 13) measure people’s opinions, attitudes and self‐reported behaviors.
- Organizational case studies, in which the researcher tells a story that tries to capture the complexity of a change effort (e.g. an attempt to implement evidence; see Chapter 14).
- Cohort studies, in which a group of individuals is followed up to see what happens to them (an example of a cohort study is the ‘big data’ variety typically involving many thousands of people, see Chapter 15).

The more common types of clinical trials and surveys are discussed in the later sections of this chapter. Make sure you understand any jargon used in describing the study design (Table 3.1).

Secondary research includes the following study types:

- Overviews, which are considered in Chapter 9, can be divided into:
1. (non-systematic) reviews, which summarise primary studies;
2. systematic reviews, which do this using a rigorous, transparent and auditable (i.e. checkable) method;
3. meta-analyses, systematic reviews that include a statistical technique to integrate the numerical data from more than one study.
- Guidelines, which are considered in Chapter 10, draw conclusions from primary studies about how clinicians should be behaving.
- Economic analyses, which are considered briefly in Chapter 12 and in more detail elsewhere [6], use the results of primary studies to say whether a particular course of action is a good use of resources.

Question Three: Was the research design appropriate to the question?

Examples of the sort of questions that can reasonably be answered by different types of primary research study are given in the sections that follow. One question that frequently cries out to be asked is this: was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) the best method of addressing this particular research question, and if the study was not an RCT, should it have been? Before you jump to any conclusions, decide what broad field of research the study covers (Box 3.2). Once you have done this, ask whether the study design was appropriate to this question. For more help on this task (which people often find difficult until they get the hang of it) see the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) website (https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford‐centre‐for‐evidence‐based‐medicine).

|Box 3.2|Broad fields of research|
|---|---|
|Therapy|testing the efficacy of drug treatments, surgical procedures, alternative methods of service delivery or other interventions. Preferred study design is randomised controlled trial (see section ‘Randomised controlled trials’ and Chapters 6 and 7).|
|Diagnosis|demonstrating whether a new diagnostic test is valid (can we trust it?) and reliable (would we get the same results every time?). Preferred study design is cross‐sectional survey (see section ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’ and Chapter 8).|
|Screening|demonstrating the value of tests that can be applied to large populations and that pick up disease at a pre‐symptomatic stage. Preferred study design is cross‐sectional survey (see section ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’ and Chapter 8).|
|Prognosis|determining what is likely to happen to someone whose disease is picked up at an early stage. Preferred study design is longitudinal survey (see section ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’).|
|Causation|determining whether a putative harmful agent, such as environmental pollution, is related to the development of illness. Preferred study design is cohort or case–control study, depending on how rare the disease is (see sections ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’ and ‘Case reports’), but case reports (see section ‘The traditional hierarchy of evidence’) can also provide crucial information.|
|Psychometric studies|measuring attitudes, beliefs or preferences, often about the nature of illness or its treatment.|

Qualitative studies are discussed in Chapter 12.

Getting your bearings: what is this paper about?

Randomised controlled trials

In an RCT, participants in the trial are randomly allocated by a process equivalent to the flip of a coin to either one intervention (such as a drug treatment) or another (such as placebo treatment – or more commonly, best current therapy). Both groups are followed up for a pre‐specified time period and analysed in terms of specific outcomes defined at the outset of the study (e.g. death, heart attack or serum cholesterol level). Because, on average, the groups are identical apart from the intervention, any differences in outcome are, in theory, attributable to the intervention. In reality, however, not every RCT is a bowl of cherries.

Some papers that report trials comparing an intervention with a control group are not, in fact, randomised trials at all. The terminology for these is other controlled clinical trials – a term used to describe comparative studies in which participants were allocated to intervention or control groups in a non‐random manner. This situation can arise, for example, when random allocation would be impossible, impractical or unethical – for example, when patients on ward A receive one diet while those on ward B receive a different diet. (Although this design is inferior to the RCT, it is much easier to execute, and was used successfully a century ago to demonstrate the benefit of brown rice over white rice in the treatment of beriberi [7].) The problems of non‐random allocation are discussed further in Chapter 4 ‘Was bias avoided or minimised?’ in relation to determining whether the two groups in a trial can reasonably be compared with one another on a statistical level.

Some trials count as a sort of halfway house between true randomised trials and non‐randomised trials. In these, randomisation is not performed truly at random (e.g. using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes each with a computer‐generated random number inside), but by some method that allows the clinician to know which group the patient would be in before he or she makes a definitive decision to randomise the patient. This allows subtle biases to creep in, as the clinician might be more (or less) likely to enter a particular patient into the trial if he or she believed that this individual would get active treatment. In particular, patients with more severe disease may be subconsciously withheld from the placebo arm of the trial. Examples of unacceptable methods include randomisation by last digit of date of birth (even numbers to group A, odds to group B), toss of a coin (heads to group A, tails to group B), sequential allocation (patient A to group 1; patient B to group 2, etc.) and date seen in clinic (all patients seen this week to group A; all those seen next week to group 2, etc.) (Box 3.3).

Listed here are examples of clinical questions that would be best answered by an RCT, but note also the examples in the later sections of this chapter of situations where other types of studies could or must be used instead.
---
# Chapter 3

|Box 3.3|Advantages of the randomised controlled trial design|
|---|---|
|1|Allows rigorous evaluation of a single variable (e.g. effect of drug treatment versus placebo) in a precisely defined patient group (e.g. post-menopausal women aged 50–60 years).|
|2|Prospective design (i.e. data are collected on events which happen after you decide to do the study).|
|3|Uses hypothetico-deductive reasoning (i.e. seeks to falsify, rather than confirm, its own hypothesis; see section ‘Three preliminary questions to get your bearings’).|
|4|Potentially eradicates bias by comparing two otherwise identical groups (but see subsequent text and Chapter 4 ‘Was bias avoided or minimised?’).|
|5|Allows for meta-analysis (combining the numerical results of several similar trials) at a later date; see Chapter 8 ‘Ten questions to ask about a paper that claims to validate a diagnostic or screening test’.|

- Is this drug better than a placebo or a different drug for a particular disease?
- Is a new surgical procedure better than the currently favoured practice?
- Is an online decision support algorithm better than verbal advice in helping patients make informed choices about the treatment options for a particular condition?
- Will changing from a diet high in saturated fats to one high in polyunsaturated fats significantly affect serum cholesterol levels?

RCTs are often said to be the gold standard in medical research. Up to a point, this is true (see section ‘The traditional hierarchy of evidence’), but only for certain types of clinical questions (Box 3.2 and see sections ‘Cohort studies’, ‘Case–control studies’, ‘Cross-sectional surveys’ and ‘Case reports’). The questions that best lend themselves to the RCT design relate to interventions, and are mainly concerned with therapy or prevention. It should be remembered, however, that even when we are looking at therapeutic interventions, and especially when we are not, there are a number of important disadvantages associated with randomised trials (Box 3.4).

Remember, too, that the results of an RCT can have limited applicability as a result of selection bias (selection of trial participants from a group that is unrepresentative of everyone with the condition), uptake bias (limited interest in the study, or ability to participate in it, from certain key groups), performance bias (differences in what is provided to the groups over and above the intervention being tested), detection bias (differences between the

|Box 3.4|Disadvantages of the randomised controlled trial design|
|---|---|
| |Expensive and time‐consuming, hence, in practice:|
| |• Many RCTs are either never carried out, are performed on too few patients or are undertaken for too short a period (see Chapter 4 ‘Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?’);|
| |• Most RCTs are funded by large research bodies (university or government sponsored) or drug companies, who ultimately dictate the research agenda;|
| |• Surrogate endpoints may not reflect outcomes that are important to patients (see Chapter 6 ‘Surrogate endpoints’).|
| |May introduce ‘hidden bias’, especially through:|
| |• Imperfect randomisation (see examples in text);|
| |• Failure to randomise all eligible patients (clinician only offers participation in the trial to patients he or she considers will respond well to the intervention);|
| |• Failure to blind assessors to randomisation status of patients (see Chapter 4 ‘Was assessment “blind”?’).|

Groups in how the outcomes are assessed), attrition bias (when one group has many more withdrawals or ‘drop‐outs’ than the other) and publication bias (selective publication of positive results, often but not always because the organisation that funded the research stands to gain or lose depending on the findings) [8]. These biases are discussed further in Chapter 4.

Note also that analysis of only pre‐defined ‘objective’ endpoints which may exclude important qualitative aspects of the intervention (see Chapter 12) and may include only the outcomes that matter most to patients (see Chapter 16). Furthermore, RCTs can be well or badly managed [2], and, once published, their results are open to distortion by an over‐enthusiastic scientific community or by a public eager for a new wonder drug. While all these problems might also occur with other trial designs, they can be particularly pertinent when an RCT is being sold to you as, methodologically speaking, whiter than white [9,10].

There are, in addition, many situations in which RCTs are unnecessary, impractical or inappropriate.

RCTs are unnecessary

- When a clearly successful intervention for an otherwise fatal condition is discovered.
- When a previous RCT or meta‐analysis has given a definitive result (either positive or negative). Arguably, it is actually unethical to ask patients to be randomised to a clinical trial without first conducting a systematic literature review to see whether the trial needs to be carried out at all.

# Chapter 3

How to read a paper

RCTs are impractical

- Where it would be unethical to seek consent to randomise.
- Where the number of participants needed to demonstrate a significant difference between the groups is prohibitively high.

RCTs are inappropriate

- Where the study is looking at the prognosis of a disease. For this analysis, the appropriate route to best evidence is a longitudinal survey of a properly assembled inception cohort.
- Where the study is looking at the validity of a diagnostic or screening test. For this analysis, the appropriate route to best evidence is a cross‐sectional survey of patients clinically suspected of harboring the relevant disorder.
- Where the study is looking at a ‘quality of care’ issue in which the criteria for ‘success’ have not yet been established. For example, an RCT comparing medical with surgical methods of abortion might assess ‘success’ in terms of number of patients achieving complete evacuation, amount of bleeding and pain level. However, the patients might decide that other aspects of the procedure are important, such as knowing in advance how long the procedure will take, not seeing or feeling the abortus come out, and so on. For this analysis, the appropriate route to best evidence is qualitative research methods (see Chapter 12).

All these issues have been discussed in great depth by clinical epidemiologists, who remind us that to turn our noses up at the non‐randomized trial can indicate scientific naivety and not, as many people routinely assume, intellectual rigor. You might also like to look up the emerging science of pragmatic RCTs – a methodology for taking account of practical, real‐world challenges so that the findings of your trial will be more relevant to that real world when the trial is finished [11]. See also Chapter 6 where I introduce the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for presenting the findings of RCTs.

Cohort studies

In a cohort study, two (or more) groups of people are selected on the basis of differences in their exposure to a particular agent (such as a vaccine, a surgical procedure or an environmental toxin), and followed up to see how many in each group develop a particular disease, complication or other outcome. The follow‐up period in cohort studies is generally measured in years (and sometimes in decades) because that is how long many diseases, especially cancer, take to develop. Note that RCTs are usually begun on people who

already have a disease, whereas most cohort studies are begun on people who may or may not develop disease.

A special type of cohort study can also be used to determine the prognosis of a disease (i.e. what is likely to happen to someone who has it). A group of people who have all been diagnosed as having an early stage of the disease or a positive screening test (see Chapter 7) is assembled (the inception cohort) and followed up on repeated occasions to see the incidence (new cases per year) and time course of different outcomes. (Here is a definition that you should commit to memory if you can: incidence is the number of new cases of a disease per year, whereas prevalence is the overall proportion of the population who have the disease.)

The world’s most famous cohort study, whose authors all won knighthoods, was undertaken by Sir Austen Bradford Hill, Sir Richard Doll and, latterly, Sir Richard Peto. They followed up 40,000 male British doctors divided into four cohorts (non-smokers, and light, moderate and heavy smokers) using both all-cause (any death) and cause-specific (death from a particular disease) mortality as outcome measures. Publication of their 10-year interim results in 1964 [12], which showed a substantial excess in both lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in smokers, with a ‘dose-response’ relationship (i.e. the more you smoke, the worse your chances of getting lung cancer), went a long way to demonstrating that the link between smoking and ill health was causal rather than coincidental. The 20-year [13], 40-year [14] and 50-year [15] results of this momentous study (which achieved an impressive 94% follow-up of those recruited in 1951 and not known to have died) illustrate both the perils of smoking and the strength of evidence that can be obtained from a properly conducted cohort study.

These are the clinical questions that should be addressed by a cohort study.

- Does smoking cause lung cancer?
- Does the contraceptive pill ‘cause’ breast cancer? (Note, once again, that the word ‘cause’ is a loaded and potentially misleading term. As John Guillebaud argued in his excellent book The Pill and Other Forms of Hormonal Contraception [16], if a thousand women went on the oral contraceptive pill tomorrow, some of them would get breast cancer. But some of those would have got it anyway. The question that epidemiologists try to answer through cohort studies is, ‘what is the additional risk of developing breast cancer which this woman would run by taking the pill, over and above the baseline risk attributable to her own hormonal balance, family history, diet, alcohol intake, and so on?’.)
- Does high blood pressure get better over time?
- What happens to infants who have been born very prematurely, in terms of subsequent physical development and educational achievement?

# Chapter 3

How to read a paper

Since the first edition of this book appeared, cohort studies have undergone a quiet revolution, due partly to the exponential increase in computer power that has occurred in the past generation (and particularly the facility to link with electronic patient records) and partly to the emergence of population genetics (see Chapter 15). Whereas 20 years ago, respectability in research circles seemed to be based almost exclusively on whether one was currently conducting a randomised controlled trial (and while clinical trials are still very important), these days the well‐dressed quantitative researcher is also expected to talk about his or her ‘cohort’, which is usually known by a catchy acronym and includes several thousand patients being followed up over time. My boss, Richard Hobbs, for example, is a quantitative researcher based at the University of Oxford. His collection of cohorts includes OXVASC (around 10,000 people who have had an acute stroke), OXVALVE (6000 older people with screen‐detected heart valve problems) and OXREN (3250 older people with chronic kidney disease). Google them to find out more.

Case–control studies

In a case–control study, patients with a particular disease or condition are identified and ‘matched’ with controls (patients with some other disease, the general population, neighbours or relatives). Data are then collected (e.g. by searching back through these people’s medical records, or by asking them to recall their own history) on past exposure to a possible causal agent for the disease. Like cohort studies, case–control studies are generally concerned with the aetiology of a disease (i.e. what causes it), rather than its treatment. They lie lower down the conventional hierarchy of evidence (in other words, they are a weaker form of evidence than RCTs or cohort studies), but this design is usually the only option when studying rare conditions – and it also offers options in genetic association studies (see Chapter 15). An important source of difficulty (and potential bias) in a case–control study is the precise definition of who counts as a ‘case’, because one misallocated individual can substantially influence the results (see Chapter 4 ‘Was bias avoided or minimised?’). In addition, such a design cannot demonstrate causality – in other words, the association of A with B in a case–control study does not prove that A has caused B.

Clinical questions that should be addressed by a case–control study include the following:

- Does the prone sleeping position increase the risk of cot death (sudden infant death syndrome) in babies?
- Does whooping cough vaccine cause brain damage?
- Did eating at a particular pizza restaurant in a particular time period cause hepatitis A?
---
# Cross‐sectional surveys

We have probably all been asked to take part in a survey, even if it was only a woman in the street asking us which brand of toothpaste we prefer. Surveys conducted by epidemiologists are run along essentially the same lines: a representative sample of participants is recruited and then interviewed, examined or otherwise studied to gain answers to a specific clinical (or other) question. In cross‐sectional surveys, data are collected at a single time point but may refer retrospectively to health experiences in the past – for example, the study of patients’ medical records to see how often their blood pressure has been recorded in the past 5 years.

A cross‐sectional survey should address the following clinical questions:

- What is the ‘normal’ height of a 3‐year‐old child? This, like other questions about the range of normality, can be answered simply by measuring the height of enough healthy 3‐year‐olds. But such an exercise does not answer the related clinical question ‘When should an unusually short child be investigated for disease?’ because, as in almost all biological measurements, the physiological (normal) overlaps with the pathological (abnormal). This problem is discussed further in Chapter 8 ‘A note on likelihood ratios’.
- What do psychiatric nurses believe about the value of antidepressant drugs and talking therapies in the treatment of severe depression?
- Is it true that ‘half of all cases of diabetes are undiagnosed’? This an example of the more general question, ‘What is the prevalence (proportion of people with the condition) of this disease in this community?’ The only way of finding the answer is to carry out the definitive diagnostic test on a representative sample of the population.

# Case reports

A case report describes the medical history of a single patient in the form of a story (‘Mrs B is a 54‐year‐old secretary who developed chest pain in June 2010’). Case reports are often run together to form a case series, in which the medical histories of more than one patient with a particular condition are described to illustrate an aspect of the condition, the treatment or, most commonly these days, adverse reaction to treatment.

Although this type of research is traditionally considered to be weak scientific evidence, a great deal of information that would be lost in a clinical trial or survey can be conveyed in a case report. In addition, case reports are immediately understandable by non‐academic clinicians and by the lay public. They can, if necessary, be written up and published within days, which gives them a definite edge over clinical trials (whose gestation period.

You can run into years) or meta‐analyses (even longer). And the clinical case is the unit of learning (doctors learn medicine, and nurses nursing, by accumulating and reflecting on individual cases). There are certainly good theoretical grounds for the reinstatement of the humble case report as a useful and valid contribution to medical science, not least because the story is one of the best vehicles for making sense of a complex clinical situation.

The following are clinical situations in which a case report or case series is an appropriate type of study:

- A doctor notices that two babies born in his hospital have absent limbs (phocomelia). Both mothers had taken a new drug (thalidomide) in early pregnancy. The doctor wishes to alert his or her colleagues worldwide to the possibility of drug‐related damage as quickly as possible [17]. (Anyone who thinks ‘quick and dirty’ case reports are never scientifically justified should remember this example.)
- A patient who went undiagnosed with chronic pain and fatigue for years was subsequently found to have an unusual presentation of a rare disease. The team caring for him or her decide to write this story up as a lesson for other clinicians [18].

The traditional hierarchy of evidence

Standard notation for the relative weight carried by the different types of primary study when making decisions about clinical interventions (the ‘hierarchy of evidence’) puts them in the following order:

1. Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses;
2. RCTs with definitive results (i.e. confidence intervals that do not overlap the threshold clinically significant effect; see Chapter 5 ‘Probability and confidence’);
3. RCTs with non‐definitive results (i.e. a point estimate that suggests a clinically significant effect but with confidence intervals overlapping the threshold for this effect; see Chapter 5 ‘Probability and confidence’);
4. Cohort studies;
5. Case–control studies;
6. Cross‐sectional surveys;
7. Case reports.

The pinnacle of the hierarchy is, quite properly, reserved for secondary research papers, in which all the primary studies on a particular subject have been hunted out and critically appraised according to rigorous criteria.

# Getting your bearings: what is this paper about?

(see Chapter 9). Note, however, that not even the most hard‐line protagonist
of EBM would place a sloppy meta‐analysis or an RCT that was seriously
methodologically flawed above a large, well‐designed cohort study. And as
Chapter 12 shows, many important and valid studies in the field of qualita-
tive research do not feature in this particular hierarchy of evidence at all.

# Chapter 3

In other words, evaluating the potential contribution of a particular study
to medical science requires considerably more effort than is needed to check
off its basic design against the 7‐point scale. A more recent publication on
hierarchies of evidence suggests we should grade studies on four dimensions:
risk of bias, consistency, directness and precision – an approach that would
complicate any simple pyramid of evidence [19]. The take‐home message is,
don’t apply the hierarchy of evidence mechanically – it’s only a rule of thumb.

A more complex representation of the hierarchy of evidence geared to the
domain of the question (therapy/prevention, diagnosis, harm, prognosis) was
drawn up by a group of us in 2011 [20] and is available for download on the
Centre for Evidence Based Medicine website (https://www.cebm.net/2016/05/ocebm‐levels‐of‐evidence/). But before you look that one up, make sure you
are clear on the traditional (basic) hierarchy described in this section.

# Chapter 4 Assessing methodological quality

As I argued in the previous chapter, a paper will sink or swim on the strength of its methods section. This chapter considers five essential questions which should form the basis of your decision to ‘bin’ it outright (because of fatal methodological flaws), interpret its findings cautiously (because the methods were less than robust) or trust it completely (because you can’t fault the methods at all). Five important questions – was the study original, whom is it about, was it well designed, was bias avoided (i.e. was the study adequately ‘controlled’) and was it large enough and continued for long enough to make the results credible – are considered in turn.

Was the study original?

There is, in theory, no point in testing a scientific hypothesis that someone else has already proved one way or the other. But in real life, science is seldom so cut and dried. Only a tiny proportion of medical research breaks entirely new ground, and an equally tiny proportion repeats exactly the steps of previous workers. The majority of research studies will tell us (if they are methodologically sound) that a particular hypothesis is slightly more or less likely to be correct than it was before we added our piece to the wider jigsaw. Hence, it may be perfectly valid to do a study that is, on the face of it, ‘unoriginal’. Indeed, the whole science of meta‐analysis depends on there being more than one study in the literature that has addressed the same question in pretty much the same way.

The practical question to ask, then, about a new piece of research, is not ‘has anyone ever conducted a similar study before?’ but ‘does this new research add to the literature in any way?’ A list of such examples is given here.

How to read a paper

- Is this study bigger, continued for longer or otherwise more substantial than the previous one(s)?
- Are the methods of this study any more rigorous (in particular, does it address any specific methodological criticisms of previous studies)?
- Will the numerical results of this study add significantly to a meta‐analysis of previous studies?
- Is the population studied different in any way (e.g. has the study looked at different ethnic groups, ages or gender than have previous studies)?
- Is the clinical issue addressed of sufficient importance, and does there exist sufficient doubt in the minds of the public or key decision‐makers, to make new evidence ‘politically’ desirable even when it is not strictly scientifically necessary?

Whom is the study about?

One of the first papers that ever caught my eye was entitled ‘But will it help my patients with myocardial infarction?’ [1]. I don’t remember the details of the article, but it opened my eyes to the fact that research on someone else’s patients may not have a take‐home message for my own practice. This is not mere xenophobia. The main reasons why the participants (Sir Iain Chalmers has argued forcefully against calling them ‘patients’) [2] in a clinical trial or survey might differ from patients in ‘real life’ are listed here.

1. They were more, or less, ill than the patients you see.
2. They were from a different ethnic group, or lived a different lifestyle, from your own patients.
3. They received more (or different) attention during the study than you could ever hope to give your patients.
4. Unlike most real‐life patients, they had nothing wrong with them apart from the condition being studied.
5. None of them smoked, drank alcohol or were taking the contraceptive pill.

Hence, before swallowing the results of any paper whole, here are some questions that you should ask yourself.

1. How were the participants recruited? If you wanted to do a questionnaire survey of the views of users of the hospital accident and emergency department, you could recruit respondents by putting an ad in the local newspaper. However, this method would be a good example of recruitment bias because the sample you obtained would be skewed in favour of users who were highly motivated to answer your questions and liked to read newspapers. You would do better to issue a questionnaire to every user (or to a one in ten sample of users) who turned up on a particular day.

# Assessing methodological quality

2. Who was included in the study? In the past, clinical trials routinely excluded people with coexisting illness, those who did not speak English, those taking certain other medication and people who could not read the consent form. This approach may be experimentally clean but, because clinical trial results will be used to guide practice in relation to wider patient groups, it is actually scientifically flawed. The results of pharmacokinetic studies of new drugs in 23-year-old healthy male volunteers will clearly not be applicable to women over 80 (most of whom have at least one other coexisting illness). A number of recent papers (see for example this one from oncology [3]) have revealed the biases against older people and those with comorbidities in the design of clinical trials. As a result, in most conditions we still don’t have a reliable evidence base for how to treat the over-80s.

3. Who was excluded from the study? For example, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) may be restricted to patients with moderate or severe forms of a disease such as heart failure – a policy that could lead to false conclusions about the treatment of mild heart failure. This has important practical implications when clinical trials performed on hospital outpatients are used to dictate ‘best practice’ in primary care, where the spectrum of disease is generally milder.

4. Were the participants studied in ‘real-life’ circumstances? For example, were they admitted to hospital purely for observation? Did they receive lengthy and detailed explanations of the potential benefits of the intervention? Were they given the telephone number of a key research worker? Did the company who funded the research provide new equipment that would not be available to the ordinary clinician? These factors would not invalidate the study, but they may cast doubts on the applicability of its findings to your own practice.

# Was the design of the study sensible?

Although the terminology of research trial design can be forbidding, much of what is grandly termed critical appraisal is plain common sense. Personally, I assess the basic design of a clinical trial via two questions.

1. What specific intervention or other manoeuvre was being considered, and what was it being compared with? This is one of the most fundamental questions in appraising any paper. It is tempting to take published statements at face value, but remember that authors may misrepresent (usually subconsciously rather than deliberately) what they actually did, and overestimate its originality and potential importance. In the examples in Table 4.1, I have used hypothetical statements so as not to cause offence, but they are all based on similar mistakes seen in print.

2. What outcome was measured, and how? If you had an incurable disease, for which a pharmaceutical company claimed to have produced a new wonder drug, you would measure the efficacy of the drug in terms of whether it made you live longer (and, perhaps, whether life was worth living given your condition and any side effects of the medication). You would not be too interested in the levels of some obscure enzyme in your blood that the manufacturer assured you were a reliable indicator of your chances of survival. The use of such surrogate endpoints is discussed further in Chapter 6.

The measurement of symptomatic (e.g. pain), functional (e.g. mobility), psychological (e.g. anxiety) or social (e.g. inconvenience) effects of an intervention is fraught with even more problems. The methodology of developing, administering and interpreting such ‘soft’ outcome measures is beyond the scope of this book. But, in general, you should always look for evidence in the paper that the outcome measure has been objectively validated – that is, that someone has demonstrated that the ‘outcome measure’ used in the study has been shown to measure what it purports to measure, and that changes in this outcome measure adequately reflect changes in the status of the patient. Remember that what is important in the eyes of the doctor may not be valued so highly by the patient, and vice versa. One of the most exciting developments in evidence‐based medicine (EBM) in recent years is the emerging science of patient‐reported outcome measures (see Chapter 16 ‘PROMs’).

Was bias avoided or minimised?
Bias is defined by epidemiologists as anything that systematically influences the conclusions about groups and distorts comparisons [4]. Whether the design of a study is an RCT, a non‐randomised comparative trial, a cohort study or a case–control study, the aim should be for the groups being compared to be as like one another as possible except for the particular difference being examined. They should, as far as possible, receive the same explanations, have the same contacts with health professionals and be assessed the same number of times by the same assessors, using the same outcome measures [5,6]. Different study designs call for different steps to reduce bias.

Randomised controlled trials
In an RCT, bias is (in theory) avoided by selecting a sample of participants from a particular population and allocating them randomly to the different groups. Chapter 3 ‘Randomised controlled trials’ describes some ways in which bias can creep into even this gold standard of clinical trial design, and Figure 4.1 summarises particular sources to check for.

# Chapter 4

| |Intervention group|Control group|
|---|---|---|
|Selection bias (systematic differences in the comparison groups attributable to incomplete randomisation)|Exposed to intervention|Not exposed to intervention|
|Performance bias (systematic differences in the care provided apart from the intervention being evaluated)| | |
|Attrition bias (systematic differences in withdrawals from the trial)|Follow-up|Follow-up|
|Detection bias (systematic differences in outcome assessment)|Outcomes|Outcomes|

Figure 4.1 Sources of bias to check for in a randomised controlled trial.

Non-randomised controlled clinical trials

I once chaired a seminar in which a multidisciplinary group of students from the medical, nursing, pharmacy and allied professions were presenting the results of several in-house research studies. All but one of the studies presented were of comparative, but non-randomised, design – that is, one group of patients (say, hospital outpatients with asthma) had received one intervention (say, an educational leaflet), while another group (say, patients attending general practitioner (GP) surgeries with asthma) had received another intervention (say, group educational sessions). I was surprised how many of the presenters believed that their study was, or was equivalent to, an RCT. In other words, these commendably enthusiastic and committed young researchers were blind to the most obvious bias of all: they were comparing two groups that had inherent, self-selected differences even before the intervention was applied (as well as having all the additional potential sources of bias listed in Figure 4.1 for RCTs).

As a general rule, if the paper you are looking at is a non-randomised controlled clinical trial, you must decide if the baseline differences between
---
# Assessing methodological quality

The intervention and control groups are likely to have been so great as to invalidate any differences ascribed to the effects of the intervention. This is, in fact, almost always the case. Sometimes, the authors of such a paper will list the important features of each group (such as mean age, sex ratio and markers of disease severity) in a table to allow you to compare these differences yourself. For a formal checklist on assessing the quality of non-randomised comparative studies, see this paper [7].

# Chapter 4

Cohort studies

In the previous chapter, I mentioned the ‘quiet revolution’ in cohort studies that has occurred in the past few years. It remains the case that the RCT is ideally the best way to assess whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But for various reasons (cost being one, computer power being another), observational studies in which nobody is randomised have become more popular. In the expanding field of comparative effectiveness studies (assessing which of two or more treatments is best in a particular condition) for example, observational studies comparing one naturally occurring cohort to another are now commonplace. For a discussion on the benefits and trade-offs of such studies, see these papers [8,9].

The selection of a comparable control group is one of the most difficult decisions facing the authors of an observational (cohort or case–control) study. Few cohort studies succeed in identifying two groups of subjects who are equal in age, gender mix, socioeconomic status, presence of coexisting illness and so on, with the single difference being their exposure to the agent being studied. In practice, much of the ‘controlling’ in cohort studies occurs at the analysis stage, where complex statistical adjustment is made for baseline differences in key variables. Unless this is performed adequately, statistical tests of probability and confidence intervals (see Chapter 5) will be dangerously misleading.

This problem is illustrated by the various cohort studies on the risks and benefits of alcohol, which have consistently demonstrated a J-shaped relationship between alcohol intake and mortality. The best outcome (in terms of premature death) lies with the cohort group who are moderate drinkers [10]. Self-confessed teetotallers, it seems, are significantly more likely to die young than the average person who drinks three or four drinks a day.

But can we assume that teetotallers are, on average, identical to moderate drinkers except for the amount they drink? We certainly can’t. As we all know, the teetotal population includes those who have been ordered to give up alcohol on health grounds (‘sick quitters’), those who, for health or other reasons, have cut out a host of additional items from their diet and lifestyle, those from certain religious or ethnic groups which would be under-represented in the other cohorts (notably Muslims and Seventh Day Adventists) and those who drink like fish but choose to lie about it.
---
# Chapter 4

The details of how these different features of teetotalism were controlled for by the epidemiologists are discussed elsewhere [9,10]. Interestingly, when I was writing the third edition of this book in 2005, the conclusion at that time was that even when due allowance was made in the analysis for potential confounding variables in people who described themselves as non‐drinkers, these individuals’ increased risk of premature mortality remained (i.e. the ‘J‐curve’ was a genuine phenomenon) [10].

But by the time I wrote the fourth edition in 2010, a more sophisticated analysis of the various cohort studies (i.e. which controlled more carefully for ‘sick quitters’) had been published [11]. It showed that, all other things being equal, teetotallers are no more likely to contract heart disease than moderate drinkers (hence, the famous ‘J‐curve’ may have been an artefact all along). Subsequently, a new meta‐analysis purported to show that the J‐curve was a genuine phenomenon and alcohol was indeed protective in small quantities [12] – but a year later a new analysis of the same primary studies came to the opposite conclusion, having placed more weight on so‐called methodological flaws [13]. And a further meta‐analysis a few years later by the same authors suggests that this conclusion still holds for this (sixth) edition of How to Read a Paper [14]. The protective effect of moderate alcohol intake is one of the best examples of the challenges of correcting for bias in non‐randomised studies; you might like to discuss it with your EBM colleagues over a beer.

If you’re looking for a definitive checklist for the quality of observational studies (both cohort and case–control), I recommend the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) Statement [15].

# Case–control studies

In case–control studies (in which the experiences of individuals with and without a particular disease are analysed retrospectively to identify exposure to possible causes of that disease), the process most open to bias is not the assessment of outcome, but the diagnosis of ‘caseness’ and the decision as to when the individual became a case.

A good example of this occurred a few years ago when legal action was brought against the manufacturers of the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine, which was alleged to have caused neurological damage in a number of infants [16]. In order to answer the question ‘Did the vaccine cause brain damage?’, a case–control study had been undertaken in which a ‘case’ was defined as an infant who, previously well, had exhibited fits or other signs suggestive of brain damage within one week of receiving the vaccine. A control was an infant of the same age and sex taken from the same immunisation register, who had received immunisation and who may or may not have developed symptoms at some stage.
---
New onset of features of brain damage in apparently normal babies is extremely rare, but it does happen, and the link with recent immunisation could conceivably be coincidental. Furthermore, heightened public anxiety about the issue could have biased the recall of parents and health professionals so that infants whose neurological symptoms predated, or occurred some time after, the administration of pertussis vaccine might be wrongly classified as cases. The judge in the court case ruled that misclassification of three such infants as ‘cases’ rather than controls led to the overestimation of the harm attributable to whooping cough vaccine by a factor of three. Although this ruling has subsequently been challenged, the principle stands – that assignment of ‘caseness’ in a case–control study must be performed rigorously and objectively if bias is to be avoided.

Was assessment ‘blind’?

Even the most rigorous attempt to achieve a comparable control group will be wasted effort if the people who assess outcome (e.g. those who judge whether someone is still clinically in heart failure, or who say whether an X‐ray is ‘improved’ from last time) know which group the patient they are assessing was allocated to. If you believe that the evaluation of clinical signs and the interpretation of diagnostic tests such as ECGs and X‐rays is 100% objective, you haven’t been in the game very long [17].

The chapter ‘The Clinical Examination’ in Sackett and colleagues’ book Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine [18] provides substantial evidence that when examining patients, doctors find what they expect and hope to find. It is rare for two competent clinicians to reach complete agreement for any given aspect of the physical examination or interpretation of any diagnostic test. The level of agreement beyond chance between two observers can be expressed mathematically as the Kappa score, with a score of 1.0 indicating perfect agreement. Kappa scores for specialists in the field assessing the height of a patient’s jugular venous pressure, classifying diabetic retinopathy from retinal photographs and interpreting a mammogram X‐ray, were, respectively, 0.42, 0.55 and 0.67 [18].

This digression into clinical disagreement should have persuaded you that efforts to keep assessors ‘blind’ (or, to avoid offence to the visually impaired, masked), to the group allocation of their patients are far from superfluous. If, for example, I knew that a patient had been randomised to an active drug to lower blood pressure rather than to a placebo, I might be more likely to recheck a reading that was surprisingly high. This is an example of performance bias, which, along with other pitfalls for the unblinded assessor, are listed in Figure 4.1.

An excellent example of controlling for bias by adequate ‘blinding’ was published in The Lancet a few years ago [19]. Majeed and colleagues

performed an RCT that demonstrated, in contrast with the findings of several previous studies, that the recovery time (days in hospital, days off work and time to resume full activity) after laparoscopic removal of the gallbladder (the keyhole surgery approach) was no quicker than that associated with the traditional open operation. The discrepancy between this trial and its predecessors may have been because of the authors’ meticulous attempt to reduce bias (see Figure 4.1). The patients were not randomised until after induction of general anaesthesia. Neither the patients nor their carers were aware of which operation had been performed, as all patients left the operating theatre with identical dressings (complete with blood stains!). These findings challenge previous authors to ask themselves whether it was expectation bias, rather than swifter recovery, which spurred doctors to discharge the laparoscopic surgery group earlier. The ethical issues surrounding sham operations are complex; see this paper for more detail on that topic [20].

Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?

As a non-statistician, I tend only to look for three numbers in the methods section of a paper. While strictly speaking, many other things are also important, these three will get you started:

a. The size of the sample;

b. The duration of follow-up; and

c. The completeness of follow-up.

Sample size

A crucial prerequisite before embarking on a clinical trial is to perform a sample size ('power') calculation. A trial should be big enough to have a high chance of detecting, as statistically significant, a worthwhile effect if it exists, and thus to be reasonably sure that no benefit exists if it is not found in the trial.

In order to calculate sample size, the researcher must ascertain two things.

1. The level of difference between the two groups that would constitute a clinically significant effect. Note that this may not be the same as a statistically significant effect. To cite an example from a famous clinical trial of hypertension therapy, you could administer a new drug that lowered blood pressure by around 10 mmHg, and the effect would be a statistically significant lowering of the chances of developing stroke (i.e. the odds are less than 1 in 20 that the reduced incidence occurred by chance) [21]. However, if the people being asked to take this drug had only mildly raised

# Assessing methodological quality

blood pressure and no other major risk factors for stroke (i.e. they were relatively young, not diabetic, had normal cholesterol levels, etc.), this level of difference would only prevent around one stroke in every 850 patients treated – a clinical difference in risk which many patients would classify as not worth the hassle of taking the tablets. This was shown over 20 years ago – and confirmed by numerous studies since (see a recent Cochrane Review [22]). Yet far too many doctors still treat their patients according to the statistical significance of the findings of mega trials rather than the clinical significance for their patient.

# Chapter 4

2. The mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the principal outcome variable.

If the outcome in question is an event (such as hysterectomy) rather than a quantity (such as blood pressure), the items of data required are the proportion of people experiencing the event in the population, and an estimate of what might constitute a clinically significant change in that proportion. Once these items of data have been ascertained, the minimum sample size can be easily computed using standard formulae, nomograms or tables, which can be obtained from published papers [23], textbooks [24], free access websites (try www.macorr.com/sample‐size‐calculator.htm) or commercial statistical software packages (see, for example, https://www.ncss.com/pass/). Hence, the researchers can, before the trial begins, work out how large a sample they will need in order to have a moderate, high or very high chance of detecting a true difference between the groups. The likelihood of detecting a true difference is known as the power of the study. It is common for studies to stipulate a power of between 80% and 90%. Hence, when reading a paper about an RCT, you should look for a sentence that reads something like this (which is taken from Majeed and colleagues’ cholecystectomy paper described earlier) [19].

For a 90% chance of detecting a difference of one night’s stay in hospital using the Mann–Whitney U‐test [see Chapter 5, Table 5.1], 100 patients were needed in each group (assuming SD of 2 nights). This gives a power greater than 90% for detecting a difference in operating times of 15 minutes, assuming a SD of 20 minutes.

If the paper you are reading does not give a sample size calculation and it appears to show that there is no difference between the intervention and control arms of the trial, you should extract from the paper (or directly from the authors) the information in (a) and (b) earlier and do the calculation yourself. Underpowered studies are ubiquitous in the medical literature, usually because the authors found it harder than they anticipated to recruit

# Chapter 4

How to read a paper

Duration of follow-up

Even if the sample size itself was adequate, a study must be continued for long enough for the effect of the intervention to be reflected in the primary outcome variable. If the authors were looking at the effect of a new painkiller on the degree of postoperative pain, their study may only have needed a follow-up period of 48 h. On the other hand, if they were looking at the effect of nutritional supplementation in the preschool years on final adult height, follow-up should have been measured in decades.

Even if the intervention has demonstrated a significant difference between the groups after, say, 6 months, that difference may not be sustained. As many dieters know from bitter experience, strategies to reduce obesity often show dramatic results after 2 or 3 weeks, but if follow-up is continued for a year or more, the unfortunate participants have (more often than not) put most of the weight back on.

Completeness of follow-up

It has been shown repeatedly that participants who withdraw from research studies are less likely to have taken their tablets as directed, more likely to have missed their interim check-ups and more likely to have experienced side effects on any medication, than those who do not withdraw (incidentally, don’t use the term dropout as this is pejorative). People who fail to complete questionnaires may feel differently about the issue (and probably less strongly) than those who send them back by return of post. People on a weight-reducing programme are more likely to continue coming back if they are actually losing weight.

The following are among the reasons patients withdraw (or are withdrawn by the researchers) from clinical trials:

|1.|Incorrect entry of patient into trial (i.e. researcher discovers during the trial that the patient should not have been randomized in the first place because he or she did not fulfill the entry criteria).|
|---|---|
|2.|Suspected adverse reaction to the trial drug. Note that you should never look at the ‘adverse reaction’ rate in the intervention group without comparing it with that on placebo. Inert tablets bring people out in a rash surprisingly frequently.|
|3.|Loss of participant motivation (‘I don’t want to take these tablets anymore’ – but more often ‘I don’t want to keep coming back to clinic and filling out long questionnaires’).|

4. Clinical reasons (e.g. concurrent illness, pregnancy).

5. Loss to follow‐up (e.g. participant moves away).

6. Death. Clearly, people who die will not attend for their outpatient appoint-ments, so unless specifically accounted for they might be misclassified as withdrawals. This is one reason why studies with a low follow‐up rate (say, below 70%) are generally considered untrustworthy.

Ignoring everyone who has failed to complete a clinical trial will bias the results, usually in favour of the intervention. It is, therefore, standard practice to analyse the results of comparative studies on an intent‐to‐treat basis. This means that all data on participants originally allocated to the intervention arm of the study, including those who withdrew before the trial finished, those who did not take their tablets and even those who subsequently received the control intervention for whatever reason, should be analysed along with data on the patients who followed the protocol throughout. Conversely, withdrawals from the placebo arm of the study should be analysed with those who faithfully took their placebo. If you look hard enough in a paper, you will usually find the sentence, ‘results were analysed on an intent‐to‐treat basis’, but you should not be reassured until you have checked and confirmed the figures yourself.

There are, in fact, a few situations when intent‐to‐treat analysis is, rightly, not used. The most common is the efficacy (or per‐protocol) analysis, which is to explain the effects of the intervention itself, and is therefore of the treatment actually received. But even if the participants in an efficacy analysis are part of an RCT, for the purposes of the analysis they effectively constitute a cohort study (see section ‘Cohort studies’).

# A note on ethical considerations

When I was a junior doctor, I got a job in a world‐renowned teaching hospital. One of my humble tasks was seeing the geriatric (elderly) patients in the accident and emergency department. I was soon invited out to lunch by two charming mid‐career doctors, who (I later realised) were seeking my help with their research. In return for getting my name on the paper, I was to take a rectal biopsy (i.e. cut out a small piece of tissue from the rectum) on any patient over the age of 90 who had constipation. I asked for a copy of the consent form that patients would be asked to sign. When they assured me that the average 90‐year‐old would hardly notice the procedure, I smelt a rat and refused to cooperate with their project.

Consideration of ethical issues is both a criminal offence and potential grounds for a doctor to be ‘struck off ’ the medical register. Getting formal ethical approval for one’s research study (for UK readers, see www.corec.org.uk), and ensuring that the research is properly run and adequately monitored (a set of tasks and responsibilities known as research governance) can be an enormous bureaucratic hurdle. Ethical issues were, sadly, sometimes ignored in the past in research in babies, the elderly, those with learning difficulties and those unable to protest (e.g. prisoners and the military), leading to some infamous research scandals.

These days, most editors routinely refuse to publish research that has not been approved by a research ethics committee. Note, however, that heavy‐handed approaches to research governance by official bodies may be ethically questionable. Neurologist and researcher Charles Warlow argued some years ago that the overemphasis on ‘informed consent’ by well‐intentioned research ethics committees has been the kiss of death to research into head injuries, strokes and other acute brain problems (in which, clearly, the person is in no position to consider the personal pros and cons of taking part in a research study) [25]. More recently, exasperated researchers published a salutary tale entitled ‘Bureaucracy stifles medical research in Britain’ [26]. The bottom line message for this book is: make sure that the study you are reading about has had ethical approval, while also sympathising with researchers who have had to ‘jump through hoops’ to get it.

Summing up

Having worked through the methods section of a paper, you should be able to tell yourself in a short paragraph what sort of study was performed, on how many participants, where the participants came from, what treatment or other intervention was offered, how long the follow‐up period was (or, if a survey, what the response rate was) and what outcome measure(s) were used. You should also, at this stage, identify what statistical tests, if any, were used to analyse the data (see Chapter 5 for more on statistics). If you are clear about these things before reading the rest of the paper, you will find the results easier to understand, interpret and, if appropriate, reject. You should be able to come up with descriptions such as those given here.

This paper describes an unblinded randomised trial, concerned with therapy, in 267 hospital outpatients aged between 58 and 93 years, in which four‐layer compression bandaging was compared with standard single‐layer dressings in the management of uncomplicated venous leg ulcers. Follow‐up was six months. Percentage healing of the ulcer was measured from baseline in terms of the surface area of a tracing of the

wound taken by the district nurse and calculated by a computer scanning
device. Results were analysed using the Wilcoxon matched‐pairs test.
This is a questionnaire survey of 963 general practitioners randomly
selected from throughout the UK, in which they were asked their year of
graduation from medical school and the level at which they would begin
treatment for essential hypertension. Response options on the structured
questionnaire were ‘below 89 mmHg’, ‘90–99 mmHg’ and ‘100 mmHg or
greater’.
Results were analysed using a Chi‐squared test on a 3 × 2 table to see
whether the threshold for treating hypertension was related to whether
the doctor graduated from medical school before or after 2005.
This is a case report of a single patient with a suspected fatal adverse
drug reaction to the newly released hypnotic drug Sleepol.

When you have had a little practice in looking at the Methods section of
research papers along the lines suggested in this chapter, you will find that it
is only a short step to start using the checklists in Appendix 1, or the more
comprehensive guides you will find in more advanced texts. I will return to
many of the issues discussed here in Chapter 6, in relation to evaluating
papers on trials of drug therapy and other simple interventions.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Find a recent paper describing a randomised controlled trial. Make careful notes on the paper, extracting data on the following:

- a. What was the research question – and what hypothesis were the authors attempting to test?
- b. Who was included in the trial – and who was excluded?
- c. What was the primary outcome measure?
- d. In your opinion, was the trial large enough, complete enough and continued for long enough to make you confident in the result?
- e. Do you think the trial needs to be repeated – if so, why?
2. Look back at the story in this chapter about the J‐curve linking alcohol intake with mortality. Do you believe that the J‐curve relationships has now been disproved? To answer this, you will need to get hold of the full text of the referenced papers and read the detailed arguments. If you don’t believe the authors of the latest meta‐analysis, can you craft a counter‐argument?
3. Can you find another example of a ‘causal’ relationship described in an observational study that was later shown to have been spurious?

# Chapter 5 Statistics for the non-statistician

How can non-statisticians evaluate statistical tests? In this age where healthcare leans increasingly on mathematics, no clinician can afford to leave the statistical aspects of a paper entirely to the ‘experts’. If, like me, you believe yourself to be innumerate, remember that you do not need to be able to build a car in order to drive one. What you do need to know (at a basic level, to get you started) is which is the best test to use for common types of statistical questions. You need to be able to describe in words what the test does and in what circumstances it becomes invalid or inappropriate. And you need to know enough vocabulary to be able to converse with a statistician. Box 5.1 shows some frequently used ‘tricks of the trade’, which all of us need to be alert to (in our own as well as other people’s practice).

The summary checklist in Appendix 1, explained in detail in the subsequent sections, constitute my own method for assessing the adequacy of a statistical analysis, which some readers will find too simplistic. If you do, please skip this section and turn either to a more comprehensive presentation for the non-statistician: the ‘Basic Statistics for Clinicians’ series in the Canadian Medical Association Journal [1–4], or to a more mainstream statistical textbook. When I asked my Twitter followers which statistics textbook they preferred, the most popular ones were these [5, 6]. If you find statistics impossibly difficult, take these points one at a time and return to read the next point only when you feel comfortable with the previous ones. None of the points presupposes a detailed knowledge of the actual calculations involved.

The first question to ask, by the way, is, ‘Have the authors used any statistical tests at all?’ If they are presenting numbers and claiming that these numbers mean something, without using statistical methods to prove it, they are almost certainly skating on thin ice.

Box 5.1 Ten ways to cheat on statistical tests when writing up results
1. Throw all your data into a computer and report as significant any relationship where 'p < 0.05' (see section 'Have p-values been calculated and interpreted appropriately?').
2. If baseline differences between pe groups favor pe intervention group, remember not to adjust for pem (see section 'Have pey determined wheper peir groups are comparable, and, if necessary, adjusted for baseline differences?').
3. Do not test your data to see if pey are normally distributed. If you do, you might be stuck wip non-parametric tests, which aren't as much fun (see section 'What sort of data have pey got, and have pey used appropriate statistical tests?').
4. Ignore all wipdrawals ('dropouts') and non-responders, so pe analysis only concerns subjects who fully complied wip treatment (see Chapter 4 'Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?').
5. Always assume pat you can plot one set of data against anoper and calculate an r-value (Pearson correlation coefficient) (see section 'Has correlation been distinguished from regression, and has pe correlation coefficient (r-value) been calculated and interpreted correctly?'), and pat a 'significant' r-value proves causation (see section 'Have assumptions been made about pe nature and direction of causality?').
6. If outliers (points pat lie a long way from pe opers on your graph) are messing up your calculations, just rub pem out. But if outliers are helping your case, even if pey appear to be spurious results, leave pem in (see section 'Were "outliers" analyzed wip bop common sense and appropriate statistical adjustments?').
7. If pe confidence intervals of your result overlap zero difference between pe groups, leave pem out of your report. Better still, mention pem briefly in pe text but don't draw pem in on pe graph and ignore pem when drawing your conclusions (see section 'Have confidence intervals been calculated, and do pe aupors' conclusions reflect pem?').
8. If pe difference between two groups becomes significant 4.5 monps into a 6-monp trial, stop pe trial and start writing up. Alternatively, if at 6 monps pe results are 'nearly significant', extend pe trial for anoper 3 weeks (see section 'Have pe data been analyzed according to pe original study protocol?').
9. If your results prove uninteresting, ask pe computer to go back and see if any particular subgroups behaved differently. You might find pat your intervention worked after all in Chinese women aged 52-61 (see section 'Have pe data been analyzed according to pe original study protocol?').

How to read a paper

If analysing your data the way you plan to does not give the result you wanted, run the figures through a selection of other tests (see section ‘If the statistical tests in the paper are obscure, why have the authors chosen to use them, and have they included a reference?’).

Have the authors set the scene correctly?

Have they determined whether their groups are comparable, and, if necessary, adjusted for baseline differences? Most comparative clinical trials include either a table or a paragraph in the text showing the baseline characteristics of the groups being studied (i.e. their characteristics before the trial or observational study was begun). Such a table should demonstrate that both the intervention and control groups are similar in terms of age, sex distribution and key prognostic variables (such as the average size of a cancerous lump). If there are important differences in these baseline characteristics, even though these may be due to chance, it can pose a challenge to your interpretation of results. In this situation, you can carry out certain adjustments to try to allow for these differences and hence strengthen your argument. To find out how to make such adjustments, see the relevant section in any of the mainstream biostatistics textbooks – but don’t try to memorise the formulae!

What sort of data have they got, and have they used appropriate statistical tests? Numbers are often used to label the properties of things. We can assign a number to represent our height, weight and so on. For properties like these, the measurements can be treated as actual numbers. We can, for example, calculate the average weight and height of a group of people by averaging the measurements. But consider a different example, in which we use numbers to label the property ‘city of origin’, where 1 means London, 2 means Manchester, 3 means Birmingham and so on. We could still calculate the average of these numbers for a particular sample of cases but the result would be meaningless. The same would apply if we labelled the property ‘liking for x’, with 1, not at all; 2, a bit; and 3, a lot. Again, we could calculate the ‘average liking’ but the numerical result would be uninterpretable unless we knew that the difference between ‘not at all’ and ‘a bit’ was exactly the same as the difference between ‘a bit’ and ‘a lot’.

The statistical tests used in medical papers are generally classified as either parametric (i.e. they assume that the data were sampled from a particular form of distribution, such as a normal distribution) or non‐parametric (i.e. they do not assume that the data were sampled from a particular type of distribution).

# Statistics for the non-statistician

The non-parametric tests focus on the rank order of the values (which one is the smallest, which one comes next, etc.), and ignore the absolute differences between them. As you might imagine, statistical significance is more difficult to demonstrate with rank order tests (indeed, some statisticians are cynical about the value of the latter), and this tempts researchers to use statistics such as the r-value (explained later) inappropriately. Not only is the r-value (parametric) easier to calculate than an equivalent rank order statistic such as Spearman’s ρ (pronounced ‘rho’) but it is also much more likely to give (apparently) significant results. Unfortunately, it will also give an entirely spurious and misleading estimate of the significance of the result, unless the data are appropriate to the test being used. More examples of parametric tests and their rank order equivalents (if present) are given in Table 5.1.

Another consideration is the shape of the distribution from which the data were sampled. When I was at school, my class plotted the amount of pocket money received against the number of children receiving that amount. The results formed a histogram approximately the same shape as in Figure 5.1 – a ‘normal’ distribution. (The term normal refers to the shape of the graph and is used because many biological phenomena show this pattern.

of distribution.) Some biological variables such as body weight show skew distribution, as shown in Figure 5.2. (Figure 5.2, in fact, shows a negative skew, whereas body weight would be positively skewed. The average adult male body weight is around 80 kg and there are people who are 160 kg but nobody weighs less than nothing, so the graph cannot possibly be symmetrical.) Non-normal (skewed) data can sometimes be transformed to give a normal-shape graph by plotting the logarithm of the skewed variable or performing some other mathematical transformation (such as square root or reciprocal). Some data, however, cannot be transformed into a smooth pattern, and the significance of this is discussed later. Deciding whether data are normally distributed is important, because it will determine what type of statistical tests to use. For example, linear regression (see later) will give misleading results unless the points on the scatter graph form a particular distribution about the regression line – that is, the residuals (the perpendicular distance from each point to the line) should themselves be normally distributed. Transforming data to achieve a normal distribution (if this is indeed achievable) is not cheating. It simply ensures that data values are given appropriate emphasis in assessing the overall effect. Using tests based on the normal distribution to analyze non-normally distributed data is very definitely cheating.

If the statistical tests in the paper are obscure, why have the authors chosen to use them, and have they included a reference? There sometimes seems to be an infinite number of possible statistical tests. In fact, most basic clinical studies can be analysed using a formulary of about a dozen. The rest are small‐print, and should be reserved for special indications. If the paper you are reading appears to describe a standard set of data that have been collected in a standard way, but the test used is unpronounceable and not listed in a basic statistics textbook, you should smell a rat. The authors should, in such circumstances, state why they have used this test, and give a reference (with page numbers) for a definitive description of it.

Have the data been analysed according to the original study protocol? Even if you are not interested in the statistical justification, common sense should tell you why points 8 and 9 in Box 5.1 amount to serious cheating. If you trawl for long enough, you will inevitably find some category of participants who appear to have done particularly well or badly. However, each time you look to see if a particular subgroup is different from the rest you greatly increase the likelihood that you will eventually find one that appears to be so, even though the difference is entirely due to chance.
---
# Statistics for the non-statistician

Similarly, if you play coin toss with someone, no matter how far you fall behind, there will come a time when you are one ahead. Most people would agree that to stop the game then would not be a fair way to play. So it is with research. If you make it inevitable that you will (eventually) obtain an apparently positive result you will also make it inevitable that you will be misleading yourself about the justice of your case. Terminating an intervention trial prematurely for ethical reasons when participants in one arm are faring particularly badly is different, and is discussed elsewhere [7].

Going back and raking over your data to look for ‘interesting’ results (retrospective subgroup analysis or, more colloquially, data dredging) can lead to false conclusions [8, 9]. In an early study on the use of aspirin in the prevention of stroke in predisposed patients, the results showed a significant effect in both sexes combined, and a retrospective subgroup analysis appeared to show that the effect was confined to men [10]. This conclusion led to aspirin being withheld from women for many years until the results of other studies (including a large meta-analysis [11]) showed this subgroup effect to be spurious.

This and other examples are given in a paper by Oxman and Guyatt [12], ‘A consumer’s guide to subgroup analysis’, which reproduces a useful checklist for deciding whether apparent differences in subgroup response are real.

# Paired data, tails and outliers

Were paired tests performed on paired data? Students often find it difficult to decide whether to use a paired or unpaired statistical test to analyse their data. There is, in fact, no great mystery about this. If you measure something twice on each participant (e.g. lying and standing blood pressure), you will probably be interested not just in the average difference in lying versus standing blood pressure in the entire sample, but in how much each individual’s blood pressure changes with position. In this situation, you have what are called paired data, because each measurement in one position is paired with a measurement on the same person in a different position.

In this example, it is having the same person on both occasions that makes the pairings, but there are other possibilities (e.g. any two measurements made of bed occupancy of the same hospital ward). In these situations, it is likely that the two sets of values will be significantly correlated (e.g. my blood pressure next week is likely to be closer to my blood pressure last week than to the blood pressure of a randomly selected adult last week). In other words, we would expect two randomly selected ‘paired’ values to be closer to each other than two randomly selected ‘unpaired’ values. Unless we allow for this, by carrying out the appropriate ‘paired’ sample tests, we can end up with a biased estimate of the significance of our results.

How to read a paper

Was a two‐tailed test performed whenever the effect of an intervention could conceivably be a negative one? The concept of a test with tails always has me thinking of devils or snakes, which I guess just reflects my aversion to statistics. In fact, the term tail refers to the extremes of the distribution – the dark areas in Figure 5.1. Let’s say that graph represents the diastolic blood pressures of a group of individuals of which a random sample are about to be put on a low‐sodium diet. If a low‐sodium diet has a significant lowering effect on blood pressure, subsequent blood pressure measurements on these participants would be more likely to lie within the left‐hand ‘tail’ of the graph. Hence, we would analyse the data with statistical tests designed to show whether unusually low readings in this patient sample were likely to have arisen by chance.

But on what grounds may we assume that a low‐sodium diet could only conceivably put blood pressure down, but could never put it up? Even if there are valid physiological reasons why that might be the case in this particular example, it is certainly not good science always to assume that you know the direction of the effect that your intervention will have. A new drug intended to relieve nausea might actually exacerbate it; and an educational leaflet intended to reduce anxiety might increase it. Hence, your statistical analysis should, in general, test the hypothesis that either high or low values in your dataset have arisen by chance. In the language of the statisticians, this means you need a two‐tailed test unless you have very convincing evidence that the difference can only be in one direction.

Were ‘outliers’ analysed with both common sense and appropriate statistical adjustments? Unexpected results may reflect idiosyncrasies in the participant (e.g. unusual metabolism), errors in measurement (e.g. faulty equipment), errors in interpretation (e.g. misreading a meter reading) or errors in calculation (e.g. misplaced decimal points). Only the first of these is a ‘real’ result that deserves to be included in the analysis. A result that is many orders of magnitude away from the others is less likely to be genuine, but it may be. A few years ago, while doing a research project, I measured a number of different hormone levels in about 30 participants. One participant’s growth hormone levels came back about a hundred times higher than everyone else’s. I assumed this was a transcription error, so I moved the decimal point two places to the left. Some weeks later, I met the technician who had analysed the specimens and he asked ‘Whatever happened to that chap with acromegaly?’

Statistically correcting for outliers (e.g. to modify their effect on the overall result) is quite a sophisticated statistical manoeuvre. If you are interested, try the relevant section in your favourite statistics textbook.

# Statistics for the non-statistician

Correlation, regression and causation

Has correlation been distinguished from regression, and has the correlation coefficient (r-value) been calculated and interpreted correctly?

For many non-statisticians, the terms correlation and regression are synonymous, and refer vaguely to a mental image of a scatter graph with dots sprinkled messily along a diagonal line sprouting from the intercept of the axes. You would be right in assuming that if two things are not correlated, it will be meaningless to attempt a regression. But regression and correlation are both precise statistical terms that serve different functions [4].

The r-value (or, to give it its official name, Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient) is among the most overused statistical instruments in the book. Strictly speaking, the r-value is not valid unless certain criteria are fulfilled.

1. The data (or, more accurately, the population from which the data are drawn) should be normally distributed. If they are not, non-parametric tests of correlation should be used instead (see Table 5.1).
2. The two variables should be structurally independent (i.e. one should not be forced to vary with the other). If they are not, a paired t or other paired test should be used instead.
3. Only a single pair of measurements should be made on each participant, as the measurements made on successive participants need to be statistically independent of each other if we are to end up with unbiased estimates of the population parameters of interest.
4. Every r-value should be accompanied by a p-value, which expresses how likely an association of this strength would be to have arisen by chance, or (better) a confidence interval, which expresses the range within which the ‘true’ R-value is likely to lie. (Note that lower case ‘r’ represents the correlation coefficient of the sample, whereas upper case ‘R’ represents the correlation coefficient of the entire population.) P-values and confidence intervals are discussed in more detail in the section ‘Probability and confidence’.

Remember, too, that even if the r-value is an appropriate value to calculate from a set of data, it does not tell you whether the relationship, however strong, is causal.

The term regression refers to a mathematical equation that allows one variable (the target variable) to be predicted from another (the independent variable). Regression, then, implies a direction of influence, although as the next section will argue, it does not prove causality. In the case of multiple

How to read a paper

Regression, a far more complex mathematical equation (which, thankfully, usually remains the secret of the computer that calculated it) allows the target variable to be predicted from two or more independent variables (often known as covariables).

The simplest regression equation, which you may remember from your school days, is y = a + bx, where y is the dependent variable (plotted on the vertical axis), x is the independent variable (plotted on the horizontal axis), a is the y‐intercept and b is a constant. Not many biological variables can be predicted with such a simple equation. The weight of a group of people, for example, varies with their height, but not in a linear way. In the first edition of this book, I gave the example ‘I am twice as tall as my son and three times his weight, but although I am four times as tall as my newborn nephew I am much more than six times his weight’. Both son and nephew now tower over me, but the example will hold. Weight probably varies more closely with the square of someone’s height than with height itself, so a quadratic rather than a linear regression would be more appropriate.

Even when you have fed sufficient height–weight data into a computer for it to calculate the regression equation that best predicts a person’s weight from their height, your predictions would still be pretty poor, as weight and height are not all that closely correlated. There are other things that influence weight in addition to height, and we could, to illustrate the principle of multiple regression, enter data on age, sex, daily calorie intake and physical activity level into the computer and ask it how much each of these covariables contributes to the overall equation (or model).

The elementary principles described here, particularly the numbered points earlier, should help you spot whether correlation and regression are being used correctly in the paper you are reading. A more detailed discussion on the subject can be found in statistical textbooks listed at the end of this chapter [5, 6], and in the fourth article in the ‘Basic Statistics for Clinicians’ series [4].

Have assumptions been made about the nature and direction of causality?

Remember the ecological fallacy: just because a town has a large number of unemployed people and a very high crime rate, it does not necessarily follow that the unemployed are committing the crimes! In other words, the presence of an association between A and B tells you nothing at all about either the presence or the direction of causality. In order to demonstrate that A has caused B (rather than B causing A, or A and B both being caused by C), you need more than a correlation coefficient. Box 5.2 gives some criteria, originally developed by Sir Austin Bradford Hill [13], which should be met before assuming causality.

# Statistics for the non-statistician

|Box 5.2|Tests for causation (see Hill [13])|
|---|---|
|1|Is there evidence from true experiments in humans?|
|2|Is the association strong?|
|3|Is the association consistent from study to study?|
|4|Is the temporal relationship appropriate (i.e. did the postulated cause precede the postulated effect)?|
|5|Is there a dose-response gradient (i.e. does more of the postulated effect follow more of the postulated cause)?|
|6|Does the association make epidemiological sense?|
|7|Does the association make biological sense?|
|8|Is the association specific?|
|9|Is the association analogous to a previously proven causal association?|

# Probability and confidence

Have p-values been calculated and interpreted appropriately?

One of the first values a student of statistics learns to calculate is the p-value – that is, the probability that any particular outcome would have arisen by chance. Standard scientific practice, which is essentially arbitrary, usually deems a p-value of less than one in twenty (expressed as p < 0.05, and equivalent to a betting odds of twenty to one) as ‘statistically significant’, and a p-value of less than one in a hundred (p < 0.01) as ‘statistically highly significant’.

By definition, then, one chance association in twenty (this must be around one major published result per journal issue) will appear to be significant when it isn’t, and one in a hundred will appear highly significant when it is really what my children call a ‘fluke’. Hence, if the researchers have made multiple comparisons, they ought to make a correction to try to allow for this. The most widely known procedure for doing this is probably the Bonferroni test (described in most standard statistical textbooks), although a reviewer of earlier editions of this book described this as ‘far too severe’ and offered several others. Rather than speculate on tests that I don’t personally understand, I recommend asking a statistician’s advice if the paper you are reading makes multiple comparisons.

A result in the statistically significant range (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 depending on what you have chosen as the cutoff) suggests that the authors should reject the null hypothesis (i.e. the hypothesis that there is no real difference between two groups). But, as I have argued earlier (see Chapter 4 ‘Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?’), a p-value in the non-significant range tells you that either there is no difference between the groups or there were too few participants to demonstrate such a difference if it existed. It does not tell you which.
---
# Chapter 5

The p-value has a further limitation. Guyatt and colleagues conclude thus, in the first article of their ‘Basic Statistics for Clinicians’ series on hypothesis testing using p-values.

Why use a single cut-off point [for statistical significance] when the choice of such a point is arbitrary? Why make the question of whether a treatment is effective a dichotomy (a yes-no decision) when it would be more appropriate to view it as a continuum? [1].

For this, we need confidence intervals, which are considered next.

Have confidence intervals been calculated, and do the authors’ conclusions reflect them?

A confidence interval, which a good statistician can calculate on the result of just about any statistical test (the t-test, the r-value, the absolute risk reduction (ARR), the number needed to treat and the sensitivity, specificity and other key features of a diagnostic test), allows you to estimate for both ‘positive’ trials (those that show a statistically significant difference between two arms of the trial) and ‘negative’ ones (those that appear to show no difference), whether the strength of the evidence is strong or weak, and whether the study is definitive (i.e. obviates the need for further similar studies). The calculation of confidence intervals has been covered with great clarity in the classic book Statistics with confidence [14], and their interpretation has been covered by Guyatt and colleagues [2].

If you repeated the same clinical trial hundreds of times, you would not obtain exactly the same result each time. But, on average, you would establish a particular level of difference (or lack of difference) between the two arms of the trial. In 90% of the trials, the difference between two arms would lie within certain broad limits, and in 95% of the trials, it would lie between certain, even broader, limits.

Now, if, as is usually the case, you only conducted one trial, how do you know how close the result is to the ‘real’ difference between the groups? The answer is you don’t. But by calculating, say, the 95% confidence interval around your result, you will be able to say that there is a 95% chance that the ‘real’ difference lies between these two limits. The sentence to look for in a paper should read something like this one.

In a trial of the treatment of heart failure, 33% of the patients randomised to ACE inhibitors died, whereas 38% of those randomised to hydralazine and nitrates died. The point estimate of the difference between the groups [the best single estimate of the benefit in lives saved from the use of an ACE inhibitor] is 5%. The 95% confidence interval around this difference is −1.2% to +12%.
---
# Statistics for the non-statistician

More likely, the results would be expressed in the following shorthand.

The ACE inhibitor group had a 5% (95% CI -1.2 to +12) higher survival.

In this particular example, the 95% confidence interval overlaps zero difference and, if we were expressing the result as a dichotomy (i.e. is the hypothesis 'proven' or 'disproven'?), we would classify it as a negative trial. Yet, as Guyatt and colleagues argue, there probably is a real difference, and it probably lies closer to 5% than either -1.2% or +12%. A more useful conclusion from these results is that 'all else being equal, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is probably the appropriate choice for patients with heart failure, but the strength of that inference is weak'.

As Chapter 8 'Ten questions to ask about a paper that claims to validate a diagnostic or screening test' argues, the larger the trial (or the larger the pooled results of several trials), the narrower the confidence interval – and, therefore, the more likely the result is to be definitive.

In interpreting 'negative' trials, one important thing you need to know is 'would a much larger trial be likely to show a significant benefit?'. To answer this question, look at the upper 95% confidence interval of the result. There is only one chance in forty (i.e. a 2.5% chance, as the other 2.5% of extreme results will lie below the lower 95% confidence interval) that the real result will be this much or more. Now ask yourself: 'Would this level of difference be clinically significant?' and if it wouldn't, you can classify the trial as not only negative but also definitive. If, on the other hand, the upper 95% confidence interval represented a clinically significant level of difference between the groups, the trial may be negative but it is also non-definitive.

Until fairly recently, the use of confidence intervals was relatively uncommon in medical papers. Fortunately, most trials in journals that follow Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines now include these routinely, but even so, many authors do not interpret their confidence intervals correctly. You should check carefully in the discussion section to see whether the authors have correctly concluded (i) whether and to what extent their trial supported their hypothesis, and (ii) whether any further studies need to be done.

# The bottom line

Have the authors expressed the effects of an intervention in terms of the likely benefit or harm that an individual patient can expect? It is all very well to say that a particular intervention produces a 'statistically significant difference' in outcome but if I were being asked to take a new medicine I would want to know how much better my chances would be.

(in terms of any particular outcome) than they would be if I didn’t take it. Three simple calculations (and I promise you they are simple: if you can add, subtract, multiply and divide you will be able to follow this section) will enable you to answer this question objectively and in a way that means something to the non‐statistician. The calculations are the relative risk reduction, the ARR and the number needed to treat. To illustrate these concepts, and to persuade you that you need to know about them, let me tell you about a survey that Fahey and colleagues [15] conducted a few years ago. They wrote to 182 board members of district health authorities in England (all of whom would be in some way responsible for making important health service decisions), and put the following data to them about four different rehabilitation programmes for heart attack victims. They asked which one they would prefer to fund.

|Programme|Description|
|---|---|
|Programme A|Reduced the rate of deaths by 20%.|
|Programme B|Produced an absolute reduction in deaths of 3%.|
|Programme C|Increased patients’ survival rate from 84% to 87%.|
|Programme D|Meant that 31 people needed to enter the programme to avoid one death.|

Of the 140 board members who responded, only three spotted that all four ‘programmes’ in fact related to the same set of results. The other 137 participants all selected one of the programmes in preference to one of the others, thus revealing (as well as their own ignorance) the need for better basic training in epidemiology for healthcare policymakers. In fact, ‘Programme A’ is the relative risk reduction; ‘Programme B’ is the ARR; ‘Programme C’ is another way of expressing the ARR and ‘Programme D’ is the number needed to treat. Let’s continue with this example, which Fahey and colleagues reproduced from a study by Yusuf and colleagues [16]. I have expressed the figures as a two by two table giving details of which treatment the patients received in their randomised trial, and whether they were dead or alive 10 years later (Table 5.2).

|Treatment|Outcome at 10 years|Total number of patients randomised in each group|
|---|---|---|
|Medical therapy|Dead|404|921|1325|
|Alive|350|974|1324|
|CABG|Dead|350|974|1324|

Simple maths tells you that patients on medical therapy have a 404/1325 = 0.305 or 30.5% chance of being dead at 10 years. This is the absolute risk of death for the control (medical therapy) group: let’s call it x.
---
# Statistics for the non-statistician

Patients randomised to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have a 350/1324 = 0.264 or 26.4% chance of being dead at 10 years. This is the absolute risk of death for the intervention (CABG) group: let’s call it y.

The relative risk of death in CABG patients compared with medical intervention controls – is y/x or 0.264/0.305 = 0.87 (87%).

The relative risk reduction – that is, the amount by which the risk of death is reduced in the CABG group compared to the control group – is 100 − 87% (1 − y/x) = 13%.

The ARR (or risk difference) – that is, the absolute amount by which CABG reduces the risk of death at 10 years – is 30.5 − 26.4% = 4.1% (0.041).

The number needed to treat – that is, how many patients need a CABG in order to prevent, on average, one death by 10 years – is the reciprocal of the ARR, 1/ARR = 1/0.041 = 24. In other words, while CABG was more effective than medical therapy, 24 people would need to have one in order to prevent one additional death.

The general formulae for calculating these ‘bottom line’ effects of an intervention are reproduced in Appendix 2, and for a discussion on which of these values is most useful in which circumstances, see Jaeschke and colleagues’ article in the ‘Basic Statistics for Clinicians’ series [3].

# Summary

It is possible to be seriously misled by taking the statistical competence (and/or the intellectual honesty) of authors for granted. Statistics can be an intimidating science, and understanding its finer points often calls for expert help. But I hope that this chapter has shown you that the statistics used in most medical research papers can be evaluated – at least up to a point – by the non-expert using a simple checklist such as that in Appendix 1. In addition, you might like to check the paper you are reading (or writing) against the common errors given in Box 5.1. If you’re hungry for more on statistics and their misinterpretation, try this classic paper ‘Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations’ by Greenland and colleagues [17].

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Take a current clinical journal and select four or five (perhaps all the research papers in one issue) that describe an intervention trial. Now, taking each paper in turn, list all the statistical tests used in the study. Can you justify why each test was used? What value did each test add?
2. Using the same set of papers, find the estimate of benefit and the estimate of harm from each treatment. Express these as number needed to treat (NNT). If this figure is not given in the paper, try to calculate it from the raw data.

3. Go back to the section on non‐parametric (rank order) statistics. Now, find a paper which uses one of the non‐parametric tests in Table 5.1. Why did the authors choose a non‐parametric test instead of a more powerful parametric test?

‘Evidence’ and marketing

This chapter is about evaluating evidence from clinical trials, and most of that evidence is about drugs (though also note that an increasing proportion of trials evaluate surgical procedures, educational interventions, talking therapies or medical devices rather than drugs). If you are a clinical doctor, nurse practitioner or pharmacist (i.e. if you prescribe or dispense drugs), the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries are interested in you, and spend a proportion of their multi-million pound annual advertising budget trying to influence you (Box 6.1) [1].

Even if you are a mere patient, the industry can now target you directly through direct-to-consumer-advertising (DTCA) [2]. When I wrote the first edition of this book in 1995, the standard management of vaginal thrush (Candida infection) was for a doctor to prescribe clotrimazole pessaries. By the time the second edition was published in 2001, these pessaries were available over the counter in pharmacies. For the past 15 years, clotrimazole has been advertised on prime-time TV – thankfully after the nine o’clock watershed – and more recently the manufacturers of this and other powerful drugs are advertising directly to consumers via the Internet and social media [3]. In case you were wondering, such advertising is often biased – for example, it tends to place more emphasis on benefits than risks and it tends to imply that the condition isn’t going to get better on its own [4].

The most effective way of changing the prescribing habits of a clinician is via a personal representative (known to most of us in the UK as the ‘drug rep’ and to our North American colleagues as the ‘detailer’), who travels round with a briefcase full of ‘evidence’ in support of his or her wares [5]. Indeed, as I discuss in more detail in Chapters 14 and 15, the evidence-based medicine movement has learnt a lot from the drug industry in recent years about changing the behaviour of physicians, and now uses the same

|---|---|
|1|Think up a plausible physiological mechanism why the drug works, and become slick at presenting it. Preferably, find a surrogate endpoint that is heavily influenced by the drug (see section ‘Making decisions about therapy’);|
|2|When designing clinical trials, select a patient population, clinical features and trial length that reflect the maximum possible response to the drug.|
|3|If possible, compare your product only with placebos. If you must compare it with a competitor, make sure the latter is given at sub-therapeutic dosage.|
|4|Include the results of pilot studies in the figures for definitive studies, so it looks like more patients have been randomised than is actually the case.|
|5|Omit mention of any trial that had a fatality or serious adverse drug reaction in the treatment group. If possible, don’t publish such studies.|
|6|Have your graphics department maximise the visual impact of your message. It helps not to label the axes of graphs or say whether scales are linear or logarithmic. Make sure you do not show individual patient data or confidence intervals.|
|7|Become master of the hanging comparative (‘better’ – but better than what?).|
|8|Invert the standard hierarchy of evidence so that anecdote takes precedence over randomised trials and meta-analyses.|
|9|Name at least three local opinion leaders who use the drug, and offer ‘starter packs’ for the doctor to try.|
|10|Present a ‘cost-effectiveness’ analysis which shows that your product, even though more expensive than its competitor, ‘actually works out cheaper’ (see Chapter 10 ‘The great guidelines debate’).|

Sophisticated techniques of persuasion in what is known as academic detailing of individual health professionals [6]. Interestingly, DTCA often works by harnessing the persuasive power of the patient – who effectively becomes an unpaid ‘rep’ for the pharmaceutical industry. If you think you’d be able to resist a patient more easily than a real rep, you’re probably wrong – as this systematic review of DTCA in psychiatric conditions showed [7].

Yourself of some basic rules of research design. As Chapter 3 argued, questions about the benefits of therapy should ideally be addressed with randomised controlled trials. But preliminary questions about pharmacokinetics (i.e. how the drug behaves while it is getting to its site of action), particularly those relating to bioavailability, require a straight dosing experiment in healthy (and, if ethical and practicable, sick) volunteers. Similarly, a medical device needs to go through a careful design phase to optimise its functionality and usability before being tested in a clinical trial.

In relation to drugs, common (and hopefully mild) adverse reactions may be picked up, and their incidence quantified, in the randomised controlled trials undertaken to demonstrate efficacy. But rare (and usually more serious) adverse drug reactions require both pharmacovigilance surveys (collection of data prospectively on patients receiving a newly licensed drug) Chapter 6 and case–control studies (see Chapter 3 ‘Cohort studies’) to establish association. Ideally, individual rechallenge experiments (where the patient who has had a reaction considered to be caused by the drug is given the drug again in carefully supervised circumstances) should be performed to establish causation [8].

Pharmaceutical reps do not tell nearly as many lies as they used to (drug marketing has become an altogether more sophisticated science), but as Goldacre [9] has shown in his book Bad Pharma, they still provide information that is at best selective and at worst overtly biased. It often helps their case, for example, to present the results of uncontrolled trials and express them in terms of before‐and‐after differences in a particular outcome measure. Reference to section ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’ and the literature on placebo effects [10,11] should remind you why uncontrolled before‐and‐after studies are the stuff of teenage magazines, not hard science.

The late Andrew Herxheimer, who edited the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin for many years, undertook a survey of ‘references’ cited in advertisements for pharmaceutical products in the leading UK medical journals. He told me that a high proportion of such references cite ‘data on file’, and many more refer to publications written, edited and published entirely by the industry. Evidence from these sources has sometimes (although by no means invariably) been shown to be of lower scientific quality than that which appears in independent, peer‐reviewed journals. And let’s face it, if you worked for a drug company that had made a major scientific breakthrough you would probably submit your findings to a publication such as The Lancet or the New England Journal of Medicine before publishing them in‐house. In other words, you don’t need to ‘trash’ papers about drug trials because of where they have been published, but you do need to look closely at the methods and statistical analysis of such trials.

Making decisions about therapy

Sackett and colleagues [8], in their classic textbook Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine, argued that before starting a patient on a drug, the doctor should:

- a. Identify for this patient the ultimate objective of treatment (cure, prevention of recurrence, limitation of functional disability, prevention of later complications, reassurance, palliation, symptomatic relief, etc.);
- b. Select the most appropriate treatment using all available evidence (this includes addressing the question of whether the patient needs to take any drug at all);
- c. Specify the treatment target (how will you know when to stop treatment, change its intensity or switch to some other treatment?).

For example, in the treatment of high blood pressure, the doctor might decide that:

- a. The ultimate objective of treatment is to prevent (further) target organ damage to brain, eye, heart, kidney, and so on (and thereby prevent serious complications such as stroke and, ultimately, death);
- b. The choice of specific treatment is between the various classes of antihypertensive drugs selected on the basis of randomised, placebo-controlled and comparative trials – as well as between non-drug treatments such as salt restriction; and
- c. The treatment target might be a Phase V diastolic blood pressure (right arm, sitting) of less than 90 mmHg, or as close to that as tolerable in the face of drug side effects.

Note that in some situations (e.g. terminal care), the ultimate objective of treatment may not be to prolong life – but whatever it is, it should be stated and the drug regimen organised to achieve it. If Sackett et al.’s three steps are not followed, therapeutic chaos can result. In a veiled slight on surrogate endpoints, Sackett and his team remind us that the choice of specific therapy should be determined by evidence of what does work, and not on what seems to work or ought to work. ‘Today’s therapy’, they warn, ‘when derived from biologic facts or uncontrolled clinical experience, may become tomorrow’s bad joke’ [8].

'drug rep'. The pharmaceutical industry is a slick player at the surrogate end-point game, and I make no apology for labouring the point that such outcome measures must be evaluated very carefully. I will define a surrogate endpoint as 'a variable that is relatively easily measured and that predicts a rare or distant outcome of either a toxic stimulus (e.g. pollutant) or a therapeutic intervention (e.g. drug, surgical procedure, piece of advice), but which is not itself a direct measure of either harm or clinical benefit'. The growing interest in surrogate endpoints in medical research reflects two important features of their use.

1. They can considerably reduce the sample size, duration and, therefore, cost, of clinical trials.
2. They can allow treatments to be assessed in situations where the use of primary outcomes would be excessively invasive or unethical.

In the evaluation of pharmaceutical products, commonly used surrogate endpoints include:

- Pharmacokinetic measurements (e.g. concentration-time curves of a drug or its active metabolite in the bloodstream);
- In vitro (i.e. laboratory) measures such as the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antimicrobial against a bacterial culture on agar;
- Macroscopic appearance of tissues (e.g. gastric erosion seen at endoscopy);
- Change in levels of (alleged) 'biological markers of disease' (e.g. microalbuminuria in the measurement of diabetic kidney disease);
- Radiological appearance (e.g. shadowing on a chest X-ray - or in a more contemporary setting, functional magnetic resonance imaging).

Surrogate endpoints have a number of drawbacks. First and foremost, the surrogate endpoint may not closely reflect the treatment target - in other words, it may not be valid or reliable. Second, a change in the surrogate endpoint does not itself answer the essential preliminary questions: 'what is the objective of treatment in this patient?' and 'what, according to valid and reliable research studies, is the best available treatment for this condition?'. Third, the use of a surrogate endpoint has the same limitations as the use of any other single measure of the success or failure of therapy - it ignores all the other measures! Over-reliance on a single surrogate endpoint as a measure of therapeutic success usually reflects a narrow or naïve clinical perspective. Finally, surrogate endpoints are often developed in animal models of disease because changes in a specific variable can be measured under controlled

Conditions in a well‐defined population. However, extrapolation of these findings to human disease is liable to be invalid [12], for these reasons:

- In animal studies, the population being studied has fairly uniform biological characteristics and may be genetically inbred.
- Both the tissue and the disease being studied may vary in important characteristics (e.g. susceptibility to the pathogen, rate of cell replication) from the parallel condition in human subjects.
- The animals are kept in a controlled environment, which minimises the influence of lifestyle variables (e.g. diet, exercise, stress) and concomitant medication.
- Giving high doses of chemicals to experimental animals can distort the usual metabolic pathways and thereby give misleading results. Animal species best suited to serve as a surrogate for humans vary for different chemicals.

The ideal features of a surrogate endpoint are shown in Box 6.2. If the rep who is trying to persuade you about the value of the drug cannot justify the endpoints used, you should challenge him or her to produce additional evidence.

If you are interested in pursuing some real examples of surrogate endpoints that led to misleading practices and recommendations, try these:

The parabasal cell index perked up and vaginal pH improved in the intended direction, allowing the researchers to claim that the drug was effective, but in reality the women in the study didn’t feel significantly less dry (I was not surprised to find that the study was funded by the drug’s manufacturer).
- The use of ECG findings instead of clinical outcomes (syncope, death) in deciding the efficacy and safety of anti‐arrhythmia drugs [14].
- The use of albuminuria instead of the overall clinical benefit–harm balance to evaluate the usefulness of dual renin–angiotensin blockade in hypertension [15,16]. In this example, the intervention was based on a hypothetical argument that blocking the renin–angiotensin pathway at two separate stages would be doubly effective, and the surrogate marker confirmed that this seemed to be the case – but the combination was also doubly effective at producing the potentially fatal side effect of hypokalaemia!

It would be unsporting to suggest that the pharmaceutical industry always develops surrogate endpoints with the deliberate intention of misleading the licensing authorities and health professionals. In early research

|Box 6.2|Ideal features of a surrogate endpoint|
|---|---|
|1|The surrogate endpoint should be reliable, reproducible, clinically available, easily quantifiable, affordable and exhibit a ‘dose–response’ effect (i.e. the higher the level of the surrogate endpoint, the greater the probability of disease).|
|2|It should be a true predictor of disease (or risk of disease) and not merely express exposure to a covariable. The relationship between the surrogate endpoint and the disease should have a biologically plausible explanation.|
|3|It should be sensitive – that is, a ‘positive’ result in the surrogate endpoint should pick up all or most patients at increased risk of adverse outcome.|
|4|It should be specific – that is, a ‘negative’ result should exclude all or most of those without increased risk of adverse outcome.|
|5|There should be a precise cutoff between normal and abnormal values.|
|6|It should have an acceptable positive predictive value – that is, a ‘positive’ result should always or usually mean that the patient thus identified is at increased risk of adverse outcome (see Chapter 7 ‘Ten questions to ask about a paper describing a complex intervention’).|
|7|It should have an acceptable negative predictive value – that is, a ‘negative’ result should always or usually mean that the patient thus identified is not at increased risk of adverse outcome (see Chapter 7 ‘Ten questions to ask about a paper describing a complex intervention’).|
|8|It should be amenable to quality control monitoring.|
|9|Changes in the surrogate endpoint should rapidly and accurately reflect the response to therapy – in particular, levels should normalise in states of remission or cure.|

Into HIV and AIDS, for example, a surrogate endpoint (the CD4 count) was used instead of mortality to accelerate the introduction of highly effective anti‐HIV drugs into clinical practice, thereby saving thousands of lives [17]. But this rush to ‘save lives’ in potentially fatal diseases can lead to an overuse of surrogate endpoints and premature licensing of dubious drugs, as a recent balanced review of the use of surrogate endpoints in cancer research showed [18]. In short, the industry has a vested interest in overstating its case on the strength of these endpoints [9], so use caution when you read a paper whose findings are not based on hard, patient‐relevant outcomes.

Surrogate endpoints are only one of many ways in which industry‐sponsored trials can give a misleading impression of the efficacy of a drug. Other subtle (and not so subtle) influences on research design – such as framing the question in a particular way or selective reporting of findings – have been

What information to expect in a paper describing a randomised controlled trial: the CONSORT statement Drug trials are an example of a ‘simple intervention’ – that is, an intervention that is well demarcated (i.e. it’s easy to say what the intervention comprises) and lends itself to an ‘intervention on’ versus ‘intervention off ’ research design. In Chapters 3 and 4, I gave some preliminary advice on assessing the methodological quality of research studies. Here’s some more detail. In 1996, an international working group produced a standard checklist, known as Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), for reporting randomised controlled trials in medical journals, and this has now been updated several times, the latest in 2010 [20], and there is now also a CONSORT statement for non‐drug treatments [21]. Without doubt, the use of such checklists has increased the quality and consistency of reporting of trials in the medical literature [22]. A checklist based on the CONSORT statement is reproduced in Table 6.1. Please do not try to learn this table off by heart (I certainly couldn’t reproduce it myself from memory), but do refer to it if you are asked to critically appraise a paper to which it applies – or if you are planning on writing up a randomised trial yourself. Incidentally, an important way to reduce bias in drug marketing is to ensure that every trial that is begun is also written up and published [23]. Otherwise, the drug industry (or anyone else with a vested interest) could withhold publication of any trial that did not support their own belief in the efficacy and/or cost‐effectiveness of a particular product. Goldacre [9] covers the topic of compulsory trial registration at inception (and the reluctance of some drug companies to comply with it) in his book.

Getting worthwhile evidence from pharmaceutical representatives Any doctor who has ever given an audience to a rep who is selling a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug will recognise the gastric erosion example. The question to ask him or her is not ‘what is the incidence of gastric erosion on your drug?’, but ‘what is the incidence of potentially life‐threatening gastric bleeding?’. Other questions to ask drug reps, based on an early article in the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin [24], are listed here.

1. See representatives only by appointment. Choose to see only those whose product interests you and confine the interview to that product.
2. Take charge of the interview. Do not hear out a rehearsed sales routine but ask directly for the information.
3. Request independent published evidence from reputable peer‐reviewed journals.
4. Do not look at promotional brochures, which often contain unpublished material, misleading graphs and selective quotations.
5. Ignore anecdotal ‘evidence’ such as the fact that a medical celebrity is prescribing the product.

1. Evaluate the evidence stringently, paying particular attention to the power (sample size) and methodological quality of clinical trials and the use of surrogate endpoints. Apply the CONSORT checklist (Table 6.1). Do not accept theoretical arguments in the drug’s favour (e.g. ‘longer half‐life’) without direct evidence that this translates into clinical benefit.

2. Do not accept the newness of a product as an argument for changing to it. Indeed, there are good scientific arguments for doing the opposite.

3. Decline to try the product via starter packs or by participating in small‐scale uncontrolled ‘research’ studies.

4. Record in writing the content of the interview and return to these notes if the rep requests another audience.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Get hold of some advertisements for drugs – both from medical journals and in publicly oriented sources (direct to consumer advertising, DTCA). What claims are being made for these products? Are the outcomes ‘hard’ or surrogate? Are the claims made to consumers different from those made to doctors? What questions would you ask a drug rep if he or she was trying to persuade you to prescribe the drug?

2. Using search methods described in Chapter 2, search the literature for evidence on the management of female sexual dysfunction. Look for review articles (especially systematic reviews). What pharmaceutical products are recommended for this condition? What outcomes are measured in studies? To what extent is the efficacy of drugs for female sexual dysfunction attributable to (a) a placebo effect and (b) the use of surrogate outcomes?

Complex interventions

In the previous chapter, I defined a simple intervention (such as a drug) as one that is well demarcated (i.e. it is easy to say what the intervention comprises) and lends itself to an ‘intervention on’ versus ‘intervention off’ research design. A complex intervention is one that is not well demarcated (i.e. it is hard to say precisely what the intervention is) and which poses implementation challenges for researchers. Complex interventions generally involve multiple interacting components and can operate at more than one level (e.g. both individual and organizational) [1,2]. They include the following:

- Advice or education for patients;
- Education or training for healthcare staff;
- Interventions that seek active and ongoing input from the participant (e.g. physical activity, dietary interventions, lay support groups or psychological therapy delivered either face-to-face or via the Internet);
- A medical device or app that requires the patient to use it in a particular way and perhaps enter data to be sent remotely to the doctor or nurse;
- Organizational interventions intended to increase the uptake of evidence-based practice (e.g. audit and feedback), which are discussed in more detail in my book How to Implement Evidence-Based Healthcare [3].

Penny Hawe and colleagues [4] have argued that a complex intervention can be thought of as a ‘theoretical core’ (the components that make it what it is, which researchers must therefore implement faithfully) and additional non-core features that may (indeed, should) be adapted flexibly to local needs or circumstances. For example, if the intervention is providing feedback to doctors on how closely their practice aligns with an evidence-based

hypertension guideline, the core of the intervention might be information on what proportion of patients in a given time period achieved the guideline’s recommended blood pressure level. The non‐core elements include how the information is given (orally, by letter or by email), whether the feedback is given as numbers or as a diagram or pie chart, whether it is given confidentially or in a group‐learning situation, and so on.

Complex interventions generally need to go through a development phase so that the different components can be optimized before being tested in a full‐scale randomized controlled trial. Typically, there is an initial development phase of qualitative interviews or observations, and perhaps a small survey to find out what people would find acceptable, which feed into the design of the intervention. This is followed by a small‐scale pilot trial (effectively a ‘dress rehearsal’ for a full‐scale trial, in which a small number of participants are randomized to see what practical and operational issues come up), and finally the full definitive trial [1].

Here’s an example. One of my PhD students wanted to study the impact of yoga classes on the control of diabetes. She initially spent some time interviewing both people with diabetes and yoga teachers who worked with clients who had diabetes. She designed a small questionnaire to ask people with diabetes if they were interested in yoga, and found that some but not all were. All this was part of her development phase. The previous research literature on the therapeutic use of yoga gave her some guidance on core elements of the intervention – for example, there appeared to be good theoretical reasons why the focus should be on relaxation‐type exercises rather than the more physically demanding strength or flexibility postures.

My student’s initial interviews and questionnaires gave her a great deal of useful information, which she used to design the non‐core elements of the yoga intervention. She knew, for example, that her potential participants were reluctant to travel very far from home, that they did not want to attend more than twice a week, that the subgroup most keen to try yoga were the recently retired (age 60–69) and that many potential participants described themselves as ‘not very bendy’ and were anxious not to overstretch themselves. All this information helped her design the detail of the intervention – such as who would do what, where, how often, with whom, for how long and using what materials or instruments.

To our disappointment, when we tested the carefully designed complex intervention in a randomized controlled trial, it had no impact whatsoever on diabetes control compared to waiting list controls [5]. In the discussion section of the paper reporting the findings of the yoga trial, we offered two alternative interpretations. The first interpretation was that, contrary to what previous non‐randomized studies found, yoga has no effect on diabetes control. The second interpretation was that yoga may have an impact but despite

Our efforts in the development phase, the complex intervention was inadequately optimised. For example, many people found it hard to get to the group, and several people in each class did not do the exercises because they found them ‘too difficult’. Furthermore, while the yoga teachers put a great deal of effort into the twice-weekly classes and they gave people a tape and a yoga mat to take home, they did not emphasise to participants that they should practise their exercises every day. As we discovered, hardly any of the participants did any exercises at home.

To optimise yoga as a complex intervention in diabetes, therefore, we might consider measures such as (i) getting a doctor or nurse to ‘prescribe’ it, so that the patient is more motivated to attend every class, (ii) working with the yoga teachers to design special exercises for older, under-confident people who cannot follow standard yoga exercises and (iii) stipulating more precisely what is expected as ‘homework’.

This example shows that when a trial of a complex intervention produces negative results, this does not necessarily prove that all adaptations of this intervention will be ineffective in all settings. Rather, it tends to prompt the researchers to go back to the drawing board and ask how the intervention can be further refined and adapted to make it more likely to work. Note that because our yoga intervention needed more work, we did not go on directly to the full-scale randomised controlled trial but returned to the development phase to try to refine the intervention.

Ten questions to ask about a paper describing a complex intervention

In 2008, the Medical Research Council (and extended in 2015), published guidance in the British Medical Journal for evaluating complex interventions. The questions at the end of the chapter, about how to appraise a paper describing a complex intervention, are based mainly on those papers. See also the recent extension of the CONSORT statement to include non-pharmacological treatments.

# Question One: What is the problem for which this complex intervention is seen as a possible solution?

It is all too easy to base a complex intervention study on a series of unquestioned assumptions. Teenagers drink too much alcohol and have too much unprotected sex, so surely educational programmes are needed to tell them about the dangers of this behaviour? This does not follow, of course! The problem may be teenage drinking or sexual risk-taking, but the underlying cause of that problem may not be ignorance but (for example) peer pressure and messages from the media. By considering precisely what the problem is,
---
# Papers that report trials of complex interventions

Question Two: What was done in the developmental phase of the research to inform the design of the complex intervention?

There are no fixed rules about what should be done in a developmental phase, but the authors should state clearly what they did and justify it. If the developmental phase included qualitative research (this is usually the case), see Chapter 12 for detailed guidance on how to appraise such papers; if a questionnaire was used, see Chapter 13. When you have appraised the empirical work using checklists appropriate to the study design(s), consider how these findings were used to inform the design of the intervention. An aspect of the development phase will be to identify a target population and perhaps divide this into sub-populations (e.g. by age, gender, ethnicity, educational level or disease status), each of which might require the intervention to be tailored in a particular way.

Question Three: What were the core and non-core components of the intervention?

To put this question another way, (i) what are the things that should be standardized so they remain the same wherever the intervention is implemented, and (ii) what are the things that should be adapted to context and setting? The authors should state clearly which aspects of the intervention should be standardized and which should be adapted to local contingencies and priorities. An under-standardized complex intervention can lead to a paucity of generalizable findings; an over-standardized one may be unworkable in some settings and hence, overall, an underestimate of the potential effectiveness of the core elements. The decision as to what is ‘core’ and what is ‘non-core’ should be made on the basis of the findings of the developmental phase.

Don’t forget to unpack the control intervention in just as much detail as you unpack the experimental one. If the control was ‘nothing’ (or waiting list), describe what the participants in the control arm of the trial will not be receiving compared to those in the intervention arm. More likely, the control group will receive a package that includes (for example) an initial assessment, some review visits, some basic advice and perhaps a leaflet or helpline number.

Defining what the control group are offered will be particularly important if the trial addresses a controversial and expensive new care package. In a recent trial of telehealth known as the Whole Systems Demonstrator, the findings were interpreted by some commentators as showing that

Telehealth installed in people’s homes leads to significantly lower use of hospital services and improved survival rates (albeit at high cost per case) [7]. However, the intervention group actually received a combination of two interventions: the telehealth equipment and regular phone calls from a nurse. The control group received no telehealth equipment – but no phone calls from the nurse either. Perhaps it was the human contact, not the technology, that made the difference. Frustratingly, we cannot know. In my view, the study design was flawed because it does not tell us whether telehealth ‘works’ or not!

Question Four: What was the theoretical mechanism of action of the intervention?

The authors of a study on a complex intervention should state explicitly how the intervention is intended to work, and that includes a statement of how the different components fit together. This statement is likely to change as the results of the developmental phase are analyzed and incorporated into the refinement of the intervention.

It is not always obvious why an intervention works (or why it fails), especially if it involves multiple components aimed at different levels (e.g. individual, family, and organization). A few years ago, I reviewed the qualitative sections of research trials on school-based feeding programs for disadvantaged children [8]. In 19 studies, all of which had tested this complex intervention in a randomized controlled trial (see the linked Cochrane Review and meta-analysis [9]), I found a total of six different mechanisms by which this intervention may have improved nutritional status, school performance, or both: long-term correction of nutritional deficiencies; short-term relief of hunger; the children felt valued and looked after; reduced absenteeism; improved school diet inspired improved home diet; and improved literacy in one generation improved earning power and hence reduced the risk of poverty in the next generation.

When critically appraising a paper on a complex intervention, you will need to make a judgment on whether the mechanisms offered by the authors are adequate. Common sense is a good place to start here, as is discussion among a group of experienced clinicians and service users. You may have to deduce the mechanism of action indirectly if the authors did not state it explicitly. In Chapter 8, I describe a review by Grol and Grimshaw [10], which showed that only 27% of studies of implementing evidence included an explicit theory of change.

Question Five: What outcome measures were used, and were these sensible?

With a complex intervention, a single outcome measure may not reflect all the important effects that the intervention may have. While a trial of a
---
# Papers that report trials of complex interventions

drug against placebo in diabetes would usually have a single primary outcome measure (typically the HbA1c blood test) and perhaps a handful of secondary outcome measures (body mass index, overall cardiovascular risk and quality of life), a trial of an educational intervention may have multiple outcomes, all of which are important in different ways. In addition to markers of diabetic control, cardiovascular risk and quality of life, it would be important to know whether staff found the educational intervention acceptable and practicable to administer, whether people showed up to the sessions, whether the participants’ knowledge changed, whether they changed their self‐care behaviour, whether the organisation became more patient‐centred, whether calls to a helpline increased or decreased, and so on.

When you have answered Questions One to Five, you should be able to express a summary so far in terms of population, intervention, comparison and outcome – although this is likely to be less succinct than an equivalent summary for a simple intervention.

# Question Six: What were the findings?

This is, on the surface, a simple question. But note from Question Five that a complex intervention can have significant impact on one set of outcome measures but no significant impact on other measures. Findings such as these need careful interpretation. Trials of self‐management interventions (in which people with chronic illness are taught to manage their condition by altering their lifestyle and titrating their medication against symptoms or home‐based tests of disease status) are widely considered to be effective. But, in fact, such programmes rarely change the underlying course of the disease or make people live longer – they just make people feel more confident in managing their illness [11,12]. But Hilary Pinnock and her team showed, in relation to self‐management interventions for asthma, improvements in both disease severity and quality of life are possible if self‐management education is accompanied by two things: addition of a personalised action plan and regular professional review [13]. If that intervention sounds complex, it is – but that’s the reality of changing behaviour.

# Question Seven: What process evaluation was done, and what were the key findings of this?

In particular, to what extent was the intervention implemented as planned ('implementation fidelity')? A process evaluation is a (mostly) qualitative study carried out in parallel with a randomised controlled trial, which collects information on the practical challenges faced by front‐line staff trying to implement the intervention [2,14]. In our study of yoga in diabetes, for example, researchers (one of whom was a medical student doing a BSc project) sat in on the yoga

classes, interviewed patients and staff, collected the minutes of planning meetings and generally asked the question ‘How’s it going?’ [5]. A key finding from this was the inappropriateness of some of the venues. Only by actually being there when the yoga class was happening could we have discovered that it’s impossible to relax and meditate in a public leisure centre with regular announcements over a very loud Intercom! Process evaluations should determine whether the intervention was implemented as planned ('fidelity') or if compromises were made (for example, reducing the intensity of contact) [15]. They will also capture the views of participants and staff about how to refine the intervention and/or why it may not be working as planned.

Question Eight: If the findings were negative, to what extent can this be explained by implementation failure and/or inadequate optimization of the intervention? This question follows on from the process evaluation. In my review of school-based feeding programs (see Question Four), many studies had negative results, and on reading the various papers, my team came up with a number of explanations why school-based feeding might not improve either growth or school performance [8]. For example, the food offered may not have been consumed, or it provided too little of the key nutrients; the food consumed may have had low bioavailability in undernourished children (e.g. it was not absorbed because their intestines were oedematous); there may have been a compensatory reduction in food intake outside school (e.g. the evening meal was given to another family member if the child was known to have been fed at school); supplementation may have occurred too late in the child’s development; or the program may not have been implemented as planned (e.g. in one study, some of the control group were given food supplements because front-line staff felt, probably rightly, that it was unethical to give food to half the hungry children in a class but not the other half).

Question Nine: If the findings varied across different subgroups, to what extent have the authors explained this by refining their theory of change? Did the intervention improve the outcomes in women but not in men? In educated middle-class people but not in uneducated or working-class people? In primary care settings but not in secondary care? Or in Manchester but not in Delhi? If so, ask why. This ‘why’ question is another judgment call – because it’s a matter of interpreting findings in context, it can’t be answered by applying a technical algorithm or checklist. Look in the discussion section of the paper and you should find the authors’ explanation of why subgroup X benefited but subgroup Y didn’t. They should also have offered a refinement of their theory of change that takes account of these differences.

For example, the studies of school-feeding programmes showed (overall) statistically greater benefit in younger children, which led the authors of these studies to suggest that there is a critical window of development after which even nutritionally rich supplements have limited the impact on growth or performance [8,9].

# Question Ten: What further research do the authors believe is needed, and is this justified?

As you will know if you have read this chapter up to this point, complex interventions are multifaceted, nuanced and impact on multiple different outcomes. Authors who present studies of such interventions have a responsibility to tell us how their study has shaped the overall research field. They should not conclude merely that ‘more research is needed’ (an inevitable follow-on from any scientific study), but they should indicate where research efforts might best be focused. Indeed, one of the most useful conclusions might be a statement of the areas in which further research is not needed! Chapter 7 The authors should state, for example, whether the next stage should be new qualitative research, a new and bigger trial or even further analysis of data already gathered.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Before you look up any literature, design a complex intervention to promote smoking cessation in pregnant women. Remember that smoking is more prevalent in poor, socially excluded (e.g. homeless) and minority ethnic groups (who may not speak English). When you have designed your intervention, do a literature search to find trials of actual interventions. What did the researchers do? What was their theory of change? What did they find – and what explains these findings?
2. Design a complex intervention to improve the quality of medical or nursing education. Think about how you might intervene to change the behaviour of both students and teachers. What is your theory of change? What initial qualitative work might you do to develop your intervention? What would be the core features of your intervention? If you were going to test this intervention in a randomised trial, what would your control intervention be – and what would your process evaluation look like?
3. Think about non-drug intervention such as education, psychotherapy or patient use of apps. Hunt out some randomised controlled trials of interventions you’re thinking of using yourself (or recommending to patients). Describe both the ‘core’ and ‘non-core’ elements of the intervention. Apply the CONSORT checklist for non-drug interventions to evaluate the study’s quality [6].

Ten men in the dock

If you are new to the concept of validating diagnostic tests, and if algebraic explanations ('let's call this value x...') leave you cold, the following example may help you. Ten men (for the gender equality purists, assume that 'men' means 'men or women') are awaiting trial for murder. Only three of them actually committed a murder; the other seven are innocent of any crime. A jury hears each case, and finds six of the men guilty of murder. Two of the convicted are true murderers. Four men are wrongly imprisoned. One murderer walks free.

This information can be expressed in what is known as a 2 × 2 table (Figure 8.1). Note that the 'truth' (i.e. whether or not each man really committed a murder) is expressed along the horizontal title row, whereas the jury's verdict (which may or may not reflect the truth) is expressed down the vertical title row.

You should be able to see that these figures, if they are typical, reflect a number of features of this particular jury.

1. This jury correctly identifies two in every three true murderers.
2. It correctly acquits three out of every seven innocent people.
3. If this jury has found a person guilty, there is still only a one in three chance that the person actually committed the murder.
4. If this jury found a person innocent, he has a three in four chance of actually being innocent.
5. In five cases out of every ten, the jury gets the verdict right.

These five features constitute, respectively, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this jury's performance. The rest of this chapter considers these five features applied to

Diagnostic (or screening) tests when compared with a ‘true’ diagnosis or gold standard. Later in this chapter, I introduce a sixth, slightly more complicated (but very useful), feature of a diagnostic test – the likelihood ratio. (After you have read the rest of this chapter, look back at this section. You should, by then, be able to work out that the likelihood ratio of a positive jury verdict in the above‐mentioned example is 1.17, and that of a negative one 0.78. If you can’t, don’t worry – many eminent clinicians have no idea what a likelihood ratio is.)

Validating diagnostic tests against a gold standard

Our window cleaner once told me that he had been feeling thirsty recently and had asked his general practitioner (GP) to be tested for diabetes, which runs in his family. The nurse in his GP’s surgery had asked him to produce a urine specimen and dipped a special stick in it. The stick stayed green, which meant, apparently, that there was no sugar (glucose) in his urine. This, the nurse had said, meant that he did not have diabetes.

I had trouble explaining to the window cleaner that the test result did not necessarily mean this at all, any more than a not guilty verdict necessarily means that someone is innocent of murder. The definition of diabetes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is a blood glucose level above 7 mmol/l in the fasting state, or above 11.1 mmol/l 2 h after a 100 g oral glucose load (the much‐dreaded glucose tolerance test, where the participant has to glug down every last drop of a sickly glucose drink and wait 2 h for a blood test) [1]. These values must be achieved on two separate occasions if the person has no symptoms, but on only one occasion if they have typical symptoms of diabetes (thirst, passing large amounts of urine, etc.).

These stringent criteria can be termed the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes. In other words, if you fulfil the WHO criteria you can call yourself

diabetic, and if you don’t, you can’t (although note that official definitions of what is and isn’t a disease change regularly – and indeed, every time I produce a new edition of this book I have to see whether the ones I have cited have changed in the light of further evidence). The same cannot be said for dipping a stick into a random urine specimen. For one thing, you might be a true diabetic but have a high renal threshold – that is, your kidneys conserve glucose much better than most people’s – so your blood glucose level would have to be much higher than most people’s for any glucose to appear in your urine. Alternatively, you may be an otherwise normal individual with a low renal threshold, so glucose leaks into your urine even when there isn’t any excess in your blood. In fact, as anyone with diabetes will tell you, diabetes is very often associated with a negative test for urine glucose – which is why urine testing is very rarely used in either diagnosis or monitoring of diabetes these days.

There are, however, many advantages in using a urine dipstick rather than the full-blown glucose tolerance test to test people for diabetes. The test is inexpensive, convenient, easy to perform and interpret, acceptable to patients and gives an instant yes/no result. In real life, people like my window cleaner Chapter 8 may decline to take an oral glucose tolerance test – especially if they are self-employed and asked to miss a day’s work for the test – or even have a blood test. Even if the window cleaner was prepared to go ahead with it, his GP might decide (rightly or wrongly) that his symptoms did not merit the expense of this relatively sophisticated investigation. I hope you can see that even though the urine test cannot say for sure if someone is diabetic, it has something of a practical edge over the gold standard. That, of course, is why some people still use it.

In order to assess objectively just how useful the urine glucose test for diabetes is, we would need to select a sample of people (say, 100) and do two tests on each of them: the urine test (screening test), and a standard oral glucose tolerance test (gold standard). We could then see, for each person, whether the result of the screening test matched the gold standard. Such an exercise is known as a validation study. We could express the results of the validation study in a 2 × 2 table (also known as a 2 × 2 matrix) as in Figure 8.2, and calculate various features of the test as in Table 8.1, just as we did for the features of the jury earlier.

If the values for the various features of a test (such as sensitivity and specificity) fell within reasonable limits, we would be able to say that the test was valid (see Question Seven). The validity of urine testing for glucose in diagnosing diabetes was assessed many years ago by Andersson and colleagues [2], whose data I have used in the example in Figure 8.3. In fact, the original study was performed on 3268 participants, of whom 67 either refused to produce a specimen or, for some other reason, were not adequately tested.

Figure 8.3 2 × 2 table showing results of a validation study of urine glucose testing for diabetes against the gold standard of glucose tolerance test (based on Andersson et al. [2]).

For simplicity’s sake, I have ignored these irregularities and expressed the results in terms of a denominator (total number tested) of 1000 participants.

In actual fact, these data came from an epidemiological survey to detect the prevalence of diabetes in a population; the validation of urine testing was a side issue to the main study. If the validation had been the main aim of the study, the participants selected would have included far more diabetic individuals, as Question Two will show [2]. If you look up the original paper, you will also find that the gold standard for diagnosing true diabetes was not the oral glucose tolerance test but a more unconventional series of observations. Nevertheless, the example serves its purpose, as it provides us with some figures to put through the equations listed in the last column of Table 8.1. We can calculate the important features of the urine test for diabetes as follows:

- Sensitivity = a/(a + c) = 6/27 = 22.2%;
- Specificity = d/(b + d) = 966/973 = 99.3%;
- Positive predictive value = a/(a + b) = 6/13 = 46.2%;
- Negative predictive value = d/(c + d) = 966/987 = 97.9%;
- Accuracy = (a + d)/(a + b + c + d) = 972/1000 = 97.2%;
- Likelihood ratio of a positive test = sensitivity/(1 − specificity) = 22.2/0.7 = 32;
- Likelihood ratio of a negative test = (1 − sensitivity)/specificity = 77.8/99.3 = 0.78.

From these features, you can probably see why I did not share the window cleaner’s assurance that he did not have diabetes. A positive urine glucose test is only 22% sensitive, which means that the test misses nearly four‐fifths of

People who really do have diabetes. In the presence of classic symptoms and a family history, the window cleaner’s baseline odds (pre‐test likelihood) of having the condition are pretty high, and they are only reduced to about four‐fifths of this (the negative likelihood ratio, 0.78; see section ‘Likelihood ratios’) after a single negative urine test. In view of his symptoms, this man clearly needs to undergo a more definitive test for diabetes [3]. Note that as the definitions in Table 8.1 show, if the test had been positive the window cleaner would have good reason to be concerned, because even though the test is not very sensitive (i.e. it is not good at picking up people with the disease), it is pretty specific (i.e. it is good at excluding people without the disease).

Despite the findings of these studies from over 20 years ago, urine testing to ‘exclude diabetes’ is still shockingly common in some (especially low‐income) settings. But the academic argument has long shifted to the question of whether the HbA1c blood test is sufficiently sensitive and specific to serve as a screening test for diabetes [4] – and (in a recent meta‐analysis by my own team) for the intermediate state of ‘pre‐diabetes’ [5]. The arguments have become far more complex as epidemiologists have weighed in with evidence on early (subclinical) microvascular damage, but the essential principles of the 2 × 2 matrix and the questions about false positives and false negatives still apply. In short, the test performs very well – but it does require a blood test and the costs are not insignificant.

Students often get mixed up about the sensitivity/specificity dimension of a test and the positive/negative predictive value dimension. As a rule of thumb, the sensitivity or specificity tells you about the test in general, whereas the predictive value tells you about what a particular test result means for the patient in front of you. Hence, sensitivity and specificity are generally used more by epidemiologists and public health specialists whose day‐to‐day work involves making decisions about populations.

A screening mammogram (breast X‐ray) might have an 80% sensitivity and a 90% specificity for detecting breast cancer, which means that the test will pick up 80% of cancers and exclude 90% of women without cancer. But imagine you were a GP or practice nurse and a patient comes to see you for the result of her mammogram. The question she will want answered is (if the test has come back positive), ‘What is the chance that I’ve got cancer?’ or (if it has come back negative) ‘What is the chance that I can now forget about the possibility of cancer?’ Many patients (and far too many health professionals) assume that the negative predictive value of a test is 100% – that is, if the test is ‘normal’ or ‘clear’ they think there is no chance of the disease being present – and you only need to read the confessional stories in women’s magazines (‘I was told I had cancer but tests later proved the doctors wrong’) to find examples of women who have assumed that the positive predictive value of a test is 100%.

# Papers that report diagnostic or screening tests

Ten questions to ask about a paper that claims to validate a diagnostic or screening test. In preparing these tips, I have drawn on Guyatt et al.’s classic chapter ‘Evaluating diagnostic tests’ [6] and Mant’s simple and pragmatic guidelines for ‘testing a test’ [7]. Like many of the checklists in this book, these are no more than pragmatic rules-of-thumb for the novice critical appraiser: for a much more comprehensive and rigorously developed set of criteria see the work of the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group [8]. Lucas and colleagues have since produced a checklist that is similar but not identical to the questions listed here [9].

# Question One: Is this test potentially relevant to my patients and my practice?

This is the ‘so what?’ question, which epidemiologists call the utility of the test. Even if this test were 100% valid, accurate and reliable, would it help me? Would it identify a treatable disorder? If so, would I use it in preference to the test I use now? Could I (or my patients or the taxpayer) afford it? Would my patients consent to it? Would it change the probabilities for competing diagnoses sufficiently for me to alter my treatment plan? If the answers to these questions are all ‘no’, you may be able to reject the paper without reading further than the abstract or introduction.

# Question Two: Has the test been compared with a true gold standard?

You need to ask, first, whether the test has been compared with anything at all! Papers have occasionally been published in which nothing has been done except perform the new test on a few dozen participants. This exercise may give a range of possible results for the test, but it certainly does not confirm that the ‘high’ results indicate that target disorder (the disease or risk state that you are interested in) is present or that the ‘low’ results indicate that it isn’t. Next, you should verify that the ‘gold standard’ test used in the survey merits the term. A good way of assessing a gold standard is to use the ‘so what?’ questions listed earlier. For many conditions, there is no absolute gold standard diagnostic test that will say for certain if it is present or not. Unsurprisingly, these tend to be the very conditions for which new tests are most actively sought! Hence, the authors of such papers may need to develop and justify a combination of criteria against which the new test is to be assessed. One specific point to check is that the test being validated here (or a variant of it) is not being used to contribute to the definition of the gold standard.

# Question Three: Did this validation study include an appropriate spectrum of participants?

If you validated a new test for cholesterol in 100 healthy male medical students, you would not be able to say how the test would perform in women.
---
# Chapter 8

How to read a paper

Children, older people, those with diseases that seriously raise the cholesterol level, or even those who had never been to medical school. Although few people would be naive enough to select quite such a biased sample for their validation study, it is surprisingly common for published studies to omit to define the spectrum of participants tested in terms of age, gender, symptoms and/or disease severity and specific eligibility criteria.

Defining both the range of participants and the spectrum of disease to be included is essential if the values for the different features of the test are to be worth quoting – that is, if they are to be transferable to other settings. A particular diagnostic test can, conceivably, be more sensitive in female participants than in male participants, or in younger rather than in older participants. For the same reasons, the participants on which any test is verified should include those with both mild and severe disease, treated and untreated and those with different but commonly confused conditions.

While the sensitivity and specificity of a test are virtually constant whatever the prevalence of the condition, the positive and negative predictive values are crucially dependent on prevalence. This is why GPs are, often rightly, skeptical of the utility of tests developed exclusively in a secondary care population, where the severity of disease tends to be greater, and why a good diagnostic test (generally used when the patient has some symptoms suggestive of the disease in question) is not necessarily a good screening test (generally used in people without symptoms, who are drawn from a population with a much lower prevalence of the disease).

Question Four: Has work-up (verification) bias been avoided?

This is easy to check. It simply means, ‘did everyone who got the new diagnostic test also get the gold standard, and vice versa?’. I hope you have no problem spotting the potential bias in studies where the gold standard test is only performed on people who have already tested positive for the test being validated. There are, in addition, a number of more subtle aspects of work-up or verification bias that are beyond the scope of this book but which are covered in specialist statistics textbooks [10].

Question Five: Has expectation bias been avoided?

Expectation bias occurs when pathologists and others who interpret diagnostic specimens are subconsciously influenced by the knowledge of the particular features of the case – for example, the presence of chest pain when interpreting an electrocardiogram (ECG). In the context of validating diagnostic tests against a gold standard, the question means, ‘did the people who interpreted one of the tests know what result the other test had shown on each particular participant?’. As I explained in Chapter 4 ‘Was assessment “blind”?’, all assessments should be ‘blind’ – that is, the person interpreting
---
# Papers that report diagnostic or screening tests

The test should not be given any inkling of what the result is expected to be in any particular case.

# Question Six: Was the test shown to be reproducible both within and between observers?

If the same observer performs the same test on two occasions on a participant whose characteristics have not changed, they will get different results in a proportion of cases. All tests show this feature to some extent, but a test with a reproducibility of 99% is clearly in a different league from one with a reproducibility of 50%. A number of factors that contribute to the poor reproducibility of a diagnostic test are the technical precision of the equipment, observer variability (e.g. in comparing a colour with a reference chart), arithmetical errors and so on.

Look back again at Chapter 4 ‘Was assessment “blind”?’ to remind yourself of the problem of inter‐observer agreement. Given the same result to interpret, two people will agree in only a proportion of cases, generally expressed as the Kappa score. If the test in question gives results in terms of numbers (such as the serum cholesterol level in millimole per litre), inter‐observer agreement is hardly an issue. If, however, the test involves reading X‐rays (such as the mammogram example in Chapter 4 ‘Was assessment “blind”?’) or asking a person questions about their drinking habits [11], it is important to confirm that reproducibility between observers is at an acceptable level.

# Question Seven: What are the features of the test as derived from this validation study?

All these standards could have been met, but the test may still be worthless because the test itself is not valid (i.e. its sensitivity, specificity and other crucial features are too low. That is clearly the case for using urine glucose to screen for diabetes; see Chapter 7 ‘Ten questions to ask about a paper describing a complex intervention’). After all, if a test has a false‐negative rate of nearly 80%, it is more likely to mislead the clinician than assist the diagnosis if the target disorder is actually present.

There are no absolutes for the validity of a screening test, because what counts as acceptable depends on the condition being screened for. Few of us would quibble about a test for colour blindness that was 95% sensitive and 80% specific, but nobody ever died of colour blindness. The Guthrie heel‐prick screening test for congenital hypothyroidism, performed on all babies in the UK soon after birth, is over 99% sensitive but has a positive predictive value of only 6% (in other words, it picks up almost all babies with the condition at the expense of a high false‐positive rate) [10], and rightly so. It is far more important to pick up every single baby with this treatable condition.
---
# Chapter 8

How to read a paper

Question Eight: Were confidence intervals given for sensitivity, specificity and other features of the test?

As Chapter 5 ‘Probability and confidence’ explained, a confidence interval, which can be calculated for virtually every numerical aspect of a set of results, expresses the possible range of results within which the true value will lie. Go back to the jury example in Chapter 7 ‘Complex interventions’. If they had found just one more murderer not guilty, the sensitivity of their verdict would have gone down from 67% to 33%, and the positive predictive value of the verdict from 33% to 20%. This enormous (and quite unacceptable) sensitivity to a single case decision is because we only validated the jury’s performance on 10 cases. The confidence intervals for the features of this jury are so wide that my computer programme refuses to calculate them! Remember, the larger the sample size, the narrower the confidence interval, so it is particularly important to look for confidence intervals if the paper you are reading reports a study on a relatively small sample. If you would like the formula for calculating confidence intervals for diagnostic test features, see the excellent textbook Statistics with Confidence [11].

Question Nine: Has a sensible ‘normal range’ been derived from these results?

If the test gives non-dichotomous (continuous) results – in other words, if it gives a numerical value rather than a yes/no result – someone will have to say at what value the test result will count as abnormal. Many of us have been there with our own blood pressure reading. We want to know if our result is ‘okay’ or not, but the doctor insists on giving us a value such as ‘142/92’. If 140/90 were chosen as the cut-off for high blood pressure, we would be placed in the ‘abnormal’ category, even though our risk of problems from our blood pressure is very little different from that of a person with a blood pressure of 138/88. Quite sensibly, many practising doctors and nurses advise their patients, ‘Your blood pressure isn’t quite right, but it doesn’t fall into the danger zone. Come back in three months for another check.’ Nevertheless, the clinician must at some stage make the decision that this blood pressure needs treating with tablets but this one does not. When and how often to repeat a borderline test is often addressed in guidelines – you might, for example, like to look up the detailed guidance and prevailing controversies on how to measure blood pressure [12]. Defining relative and absolute danger zones for a continuous physiological or pathological variable is a complex science, which should take into account the actual likelihood of the adverse outcome that the proposed treatment aims to prevent. This process is made
---
# Papers that report diagnostic or screening tests

Considerably more objective by the use of likelihood ratios (see section 'Likelihood ratios').

# Question Ten: Has this test been placed in the context of other potential tests in the diagnostic sequence for the condition?

In general, we treat high blood pressure on the basis of the blood pressure reading alone (although, as mentioned, guidelines recommend basing management on a series of readings rather than a single value). Compare this with the sequence we use to diagnose stenosis (hardening) of the coronary arteries. First, we select patients with a typical history of effort angina (chest pain on exercise). Next, we usually carry out a resting ECG, an exercise ECG and perhaps a radionucleide scan of the heart to look for areas short of oxygen. Most patients only come to a coronary angiogram (the definitive investigation for coronary artery stenosis) after they have produced an abnormal result on these preliminary tests.

If you took 100 people off the street and sent them straight for a coronary angiogram, the test might display very different positive and negative predictive values (and even different sensitivity and specificity) than it did in the sicker population on which it was originally validated. This means that the various aspects of validity of the coronary angiogram as a diagnostic test are virtually meaningless unless these figures are expressed in terms of what they contribute to the overall diagnostic work-up.

# Likelihood ratios

Question Nine described the problem of defining a normal range for a continuous variable. In such circumstances, it can be preferable to express the test result not as 'normal' or 'abnormal', but in terms of the actual chances of a patient having the target disorder if the test result reaches a particular level. Take, for example, the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test to screen for prostate cancer. Most men will have some detectable PSA in their blood (say, 0.5 ng/ml), and most of those with advanced prostate cancer will have very high levels of PSA (above about 20 ng/ml). But a PSA level of, say, 7.4 ng/ml can be found either in a perfectly normal man or in someone with early cancer. There simply is not a clean cut-off between normal and abnormal [13].

We can, however, use the results of a validation study of the PSA test against a gold standard for prostate cancer (say, a biopsy) to draw up a whole series of 2 × 2 tables. Each table would use a different definition of an abnormal PSA result to classify patients as 'normal' or 'abnormal'. From these tables, we could generate different likelihood ratios associated with a PSA level above each different cut-off point. Then, when faced with a PSA result in the 'grey zone', we would at least be able to say, 'this test has not proved that.

The patient has prostate cancer, but it has increased (or decreased) the odds of that diagnosis by a factor of x’. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the PSA test is not a terribly good discriminator between the presence and absence of cancer, whatever cut‐off value is used – in other words, there is no value for PSA that gives a particularly high likelihood ratio in cancer detection. The latest advice is to share these uncertainties with the patient and let him decide whether to have the test [13].

Although the likelihood ratio is one of the more complicated aspects of a diagnostic test to calculate, it has enormous practical value, and it is becoming the preferred way of expressing and comparing the usefulness of different tests. The likelihood ratio is a particularly helpful test for ruling a particular diagnosis in or out. For example, if a person enters my consulting room with no symptoms at all, I know (on the basis of some rather old epidemiological studies) that they have a 5% chance of having iron‐deficiency anaemia, because around one person in 20 in the UK population has this condition. In the language of diagnostic tests, this means that the pre‐test probability of anaemia, equivalent to the prevalence of the condition, is 0.05.

Now, if I carry out a diagnostic test for anaemia, the serum ferritin level, the result will usually make the diagnosis of anaemia either more or less likely. A moderately reduced serum ferritin level (between 18 and 45 μg/l) has a likelihood ratio of 3, so the chances of a patient with this result having iron‐deficiency anaemia is generally calculated as 0.05 × 3 – or 0.15 (15%). This value is known as the post‐test probability of the serum ferritin test. (Strictly speaking, likelihood ratios should be used on odds rather than on probabilities, but the simpler method shown here gives a good approximation when the pre‐test probability is low. In this example, a pre‐test probability of 5% is equal to a pre‐test odds of 0.05/0.95 or 0.053; a positive test with a likelihood ratio of 3 gives a post‐test odds of 0.158, which is equal to a post‐test probability of 14%) [14].

Figure 8.4 shows a nomogram, adapted by Sackett and colleagues from an original paper by Fagan [15], for working out post‐test probabilities when the pre‐test probability (prevalence) and likelihood ratio for the test are known. The lines A, B and C, drawn from a pre‐test probability of 25% (the prevalence of smoking amongst British adults) are, respectively, the trajectories through likelihood ratios of 15, 100 and 0.015 – three different (and all somewhat old) tests for detecting whether someone is a smoker. Actually, test C detects whether the person is a non‐smoker, as a positive result in this test leads to a post‐test probability of only 0.5%.

In summary, as I said at the beginning of this chapter, you can go a long way with diagnostic tests without referring to likelihood ratios. I avoided them myself for years. But if you put aside an afternoon to get to grips with this aspect of clinical epidemiology, I predict that your time will have been well spent.

How to read a paper

When it comes to assessing a man’s risk of prostate cancer, a combination of several tests is used, including the overall clinical assessment and a digital rectal examination [13]. In general, clinicians tend to use a combination of several different diagnostic tests, such as clinical examination, blood tests, X-rays, etc., to build up a comprehensive picture of the patient's condition. While individual tests may have a fuzzy boundary between normal and abnormal, combining them can enhance the diagnostic focus. For example, a woman presenting with a breast lump is typically offered three different tests, namely fine needle aspiration, X-ray (mammogram), and ultrasound [16]. This principle of conducting multiple tests and combining the results has been a longstanding practice in clinical settings, further elaborated by Falk and Fahey [17]. By observing large groups of patients with specific symptoms and meticulously documenting clinical examination findings and diagnostic test results, numerical estimates can be derived regarding the likelihood of a person having or developing a particular disease in the presence of certain symptoms, physical signs, diagnostic tests, or their combinations. Interest and research in clinical prediction rules have been rapidly increasing, facilitated by the advancement of information technology allowing clinicians to input large patient datasets into online databases from various centers.

Falk and Fahey outline three stages in the development of a clinical prediction rule. Firstly, the rule must be formulated by determining the independent and combined effects of explanatory variables such as symptoms, signs, or diagnostic tests on the diagnosis. Secondly, these explanatory variables should be evaluated in diverse populations. Lastly, an impact analysis should be conducted, ideally through a randomized trial that assesses the effects of applying the rule in a clinical setting on patient outcomes, clinician behavior, resource utilization, and other relevant factors.

For examples illustrating how clinical prediction rules can assist in addressing complex diagnostic dilemmas in healthcare, refer to studies on predicting whether a head-injured child should undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan [18], determining if someone with early arthritis is progressing to rheumatoid arthritis [19], and identifying the best test combinations to predict if a seriously ill child has any underlying conditions [20]. A recent addition to the JAMA series 'Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature' delved into clinical prediction rules [21].

Exercises based on this chapter

1. Think about the last diagnostic test you used on a patient (or yourself) and search the literature for evidence on that.

# Papers that report diagnostic or screening tests

1. What is its sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value? What is its overall accuracy? Did you interpret the test result as definitive – and have you now changed your mind?

2. Using the results of the previous exercise, design a leaflet or website to explain to patients what your chosen test is and how it might mislead them.

3. Search the literature for a clinical prediction rule on a topic you are interested in. Would you actually use this rule in practice? If not, why not? Why do you think clinicians are not currently using it?

When is a review systematic?

Remember the essays you used to write when you first started college? You would mooch round the library, browsing through the indexes of books and journals. When you came across a paragraph that looked relevant you copied it out, and if anything you found did not fit in with the theory you were proposing, you left it out. This, more or less, constitutes the journalistic review – an overview of primary studies that have not been identified or analysed in a systematic (i.e. standardised and objective) way. Journalists get paid according to how much they write rather than how much they read or how critically they process it, which explains why most of the ‘new scientific breakthroughs’ you read in your newspaper today will probably be discredited before the month is out. A common variant of the journalistic review is the invited review, written when an editor asks one of his or her friends to pen a piece, and summed up by this fabulous title: ‘The invited review? Or, my field, from my standpoint, written by me using only my data and my ideas, and citing only my publications’ [1]! (I am here critiquing a certain kind of journalism, and doing so to set up an extreme position from which I will then depart. High-quality investigative journalism is an altogether different art – but that is a topic for a different book.)

In contrast, a systematic review is an overview of primary studies that:

- contains a statement of objectives, sources and methods;
- has been conducted in a way that is explicit, transparent and reproducible (Figure 9.1).

The most enduring and reliable systematic reviews, notably those undertaken by the Cochrane Collaboration (discussed later in this chapter), are regularly updated to incorporate new evidence.

As my colleague Paul Knipschild observed some years ago, Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling [2] once published a review, based on selected referencing of the studies that supported his hypothesis, showing that vitamin C cured the common cold. A more objective analysis showed that while one of two did indeed suggest an effect, a true estimate based on all the available studies suggested that vitamin C had no effect at all on the course of the common cold. Pauling probably did not deliberately intend to deceive his readers, but because his enthusiasm for his espoused cause outweighed his scientific objectivity, he was unaware of the selection bias influencing his choice of papers. Evidence shows that if you or I were to attempt what Pauling did – that is, hunt through the medical literature for ‘evidence’ to support our pet theory – we would make an equally idiosyncratic and unscientific job of it [3]. Some advantages of the systematic review are given in Box 9.1.

Experts, who have been steeped in a subject for years and know what the answer ‘ought’ to be, were once shown to be significantly less able to produce

Box 9.1 Advantages of systematic reviews [2]

- Explicit methods limit bias in identifying and rejecting studies.
- Conclusions are hence more reliable and accurate.
- Large amounts of information can be assimilated quickly by healthcare providers, researchers and policymakers.
- Delay between research discoveries and implementation of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies is reduced.
- Results of different studies can be formally compared to establish generalisability of findings and consistency (lack of heterogeneity) of results.
- Reasons for heterogeneity (inconsistency in results across studies) can be identified and new hypotheses generated about particular subgroups.
- Quantitative systematic reviews (meta-analyses) increase the precision of the overall result (see Chapter 4 ‘Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?’ and Chapter 8 ‘Ten questions to ask about a paper that claims to validate a diagnostic or screening test’).

An objective review of the literature in their subject than non-experts [4]. This would have been of little consequence if experts’ opinion could be relied upon to be congruent with the results of independent systematic reviews, but at the time they most certainly couldn’t [5]. These condemning studies are still widely quoted by people who would replace all subject experts (such as cardiologists) with search-and-appraisal experts (people who specialise in finding and criticising papers on any subject). But no one in more recent years has replicated the findings – in other words, perhaps we should credit today’s experts with more of a tendency to read the systematic reviews in their own topic area! As a general rule, if you want to seek out the best objective evidence of the benefits of (say) different anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation, you should ask someone who is an expert in systematic reviews to work alongside an expert in atrial fibrillation.

To be fair to Pauling [2], he did mention a number of trials whose results seriously challenged his theory that vitamin C prevents the common cold. But he described all such trials as ‘methodologically flawed’. So were many of the trials that Pauling did include in his analysis, but because their results were consistent with Pauling’s views, he was, perhaps subconsciously, less critical of weaknesses in their design [6].

I mention this example to illustrate the point that, when undertaking a systematic review, not only must the search for relevant articles be thorough and objective, but the criteria used to reject articles as ‘flawed’ must be explicit and independent of the results of those trials. In other words, you don’t trash a trial because all other trials in this area showed something.

different (see section ‘Explaining heterogeneity’); you trash it because, whatever the results showed, the trial’s objectives or methods did not meet your inclusion criteria and quality standards.

Evaluating systematic reviews

A major development in evidence-based healthcare since I wrote the first edition of this book in 1995 has been the agreement on a standard, structured format for writing up and presenting systematic reviews. The original version of this was called the QUORUM statement (equivalent to the CONSORT format for reporting randomised controlled trials discussed in Chapter 5). It was subsequently updated as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [7]. Following these structured checklists makes systematic reviews and meta-analyses a whole lot easier to find your way around. If systematic reviews float your boat, you may also like to consult the book that systematic reviewers call their ‘bible’: the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews (but be warned – it’s a weighty tome) [8].

Here are some questions based on the PRISMA checklist (but greatly shortened and simplified) to ask about any systematic review of quantitative evidence.

Question One: What is the important clinical question that the review addressed?

Look back to Chapter 3, in which I explained the importance of defining the question when reading a paper about a clinical trial or other form of primary research. I called this getting your bearings because one sure way to be confused about a paper is to fail to ascertain what it is about. The definition of a specific answerable question is, if anything, even more important (and even more frequently omitted!) when preparing an overview of primary studies. If you have ever tried to pull together the findings of a dozen or more clinical papers into an essay, editorial or summary notes for an examination, you will know that it is all too easy to meander into aspects of the topic that you never intended to cover.

The question addressed by a systematic review needs to be defined very precisely, as the reviewer must make a dichotomous (yes/no) decision as to whether each potentially relevant paper will be included or, alternatively, rejected as ‘irrelevant’. The question, ‘do anticoagulants prevent strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation?’ sounds pretty specific, until you start looking through the list of possible studies to include. Does ‘atrial fibrillation’ include both rheumatic and non-rheumatic forms (which are known to be associated with very different risks of stroke), and does it include
---
# Papers that summarise other papers

intermittent atrial fibrillation? My grandfather, for example, used to go into
this arrhythmia for a few hours on the rare occasions when he drank coffee
and would have counted as a ‘grey case’ in any trial.
Does ‘stroke’ include both ischaemic stroke (caused by a blocked blood
vessel in the brain) and haemorrhagic stroke (caused by a burst blood vessel)?
And, talking of burst blood vessels, shouldn’t we be weighing the side effects
of anticoagulants against their possible benefits? Does ‘anticoagulant’ mean
the narrow sense of the term (i.e. drugs that work on the clotting cascade)
such as heparin, warfarin and dabigatran, or does it also include drugs that
reduce platelet stickiness, such as dabigatran? Finally, should the review
cover trials on people who have already had a previous stroke or transient
ischaemic attack (a mild stroke that gets better within 24 h), or should it be
limited to trials on individuals without these major risk factors for a further
stroke? The ‘simple’ question posed earlier is becoming unanswerable, and
we must refine it in this manner.

To assess the effectiveness and safety of warfarin‐type anticoagulant
therapy in secondary prevention (i.e. following a previous stroke or tran-
sient ischaemic attack) in patients with all forms of atrial fibrillation:
comparison with antiplatelet therapy [9].

# Question Two: Was a thorough search carried out of the appropriate database(s), Chapter 9
and were other potentially important sources explored?

As Figure 9.1 illustrates, one of the benefits of a systematic review is that,
unlike a narrative or journalistic review, the author is required to tell you
where the information in it came from and how it was processed. As I
explained in Chapter 2, searching the Medline database for relevant articles
is a sophisticated science, and even the best Medline search will miss impor-
tant papers. Some additional sources are shown in Box 9.2. The reviewer who
seeks a comprehensive set of primary studies must approach the many other
databases listed in Chapter 2 (and perhaps others too – ask your librarian).

In the search for trials to include in a review, try to avoid linguistic impe-
rialism. As much weight must be given, for example, to the expressions ‘Eine
Placebo‐kontrollierte Doppel‐blindstudie’ and ‘une étude randomisée a dou-
ble insu face au placebo’ as to ‘a double‐blind, randomised controlled trial’
[6], although omission of other‐language studies is not, generally, associated
with biased results [10]. Furthermore, particularly where a statistical synthe-
sis of results (meta‐analysis) is contemplated, it may be necessary to write
and ask the authors of the primary studies for data that were not originally
included in the published review.

Even when all this has been done, the systematic reviewer’s search for
material has hardly begun. As Knipschild [6] and his team showed when they

Searched for trials on vitamin C and cold prevention, their electronic databases only gave them 22 of their final total of 61 trials. Another 39 trials were uncovered by hand‐searching the manual precursor to the PubMed database, the Index Medicus (14 trials not identified previously), and searching the references of the trials identified in Medline (15 more trials), the references of the references (9 further trials) and the references of the references of the references (one additional trial not identified by any of the previous searches).

Do not be too hard on a reviewer, however, if he or she has not followed this counsel of perfection to the letter. Knipschild’s additional papers from lesser‐known databases added little to the overall synthesis. There is growing evidence that most high‐quality studies can be identified by searching a limited number of databases [11] and by ‘citation chaining’ studies that are seminal in the field [12]. Indeed, growing evidence that exhaustive searching tends to produce diminished returns (not to mention exhausted reviewers) has informed the new science of ‘rapid systematic review’, defined as ‘a form of knowledge synthesis in which components of the systematic review process are simplified or omitted to produce information in a timely manner’ [13]. Note that a rapid systematic review is not the same as a random, half‐hearted review. Like all systematic reviews, rapid reviews must include a rigorous methods section – but for practical purposes they are allowed to leave some stones unturned. The Cochrane Collaboration has a methods group devoted to rapid systematic reviews [14].

Question Three: Was methodological quality assessed and the trials weighted accordingly?

Chapters 3 and 4 and Appendix 1 provide some checklists for assessing whether a paper should be rejected outright on methodological grounds.
---
Papers that summarise other papers

But given that only around 1% of clinical trials are said to be beyond criticism methodologically, the practical question is how to ensure that a ‘small but perfectly formed’ study is given the weight it deserves in relation to a larger study whose methods are adequate but more open to criticism. As the PRISMA statement emphasises, the key question is the extent to which the methodological flaws are likely to have biased the review’s findings [7]. Methodological shortcomings that invalidate the results of trials are often generic (i.e. they are independent of the subject matter of the study; see Appendix 1), but there may also be certain methodological features that distinguish between good, medium and poor quality in a particular field. Hence, one of the tasks of a systematic reviewer is to draw up a list of criteria, including both generic and particular aspects of quality, against which to judge each trial. In theory, a composite numerical score could be calculated which would reflect ‘overall methodological quality’. In reality, however, care should be taken in developing such scores as there is no gold standard for the ‘true’ methodological quality of a trial and such composite scores may prove neither valid nor reliable in practice. If you’re interested in reading more about the science of developing and applying quality criteria to studies as part of a systematic review, see the latest edition of the Cochrane Reviewers’ Handbook [8].

Question Four: How sensitive are the results to the way the review has been performed? Chapter 9 If you don’t understand what this question means, look up the tongue‐in‐cheek paper by Counsell and colleagues [15] some years ago in the British Medical Journal, which ‘proved’ an entirely spurious relationship between the result of shaking a dice and the outcome of an acute stroke. The authors report a series of artificial dice‐rolling experiments in which red, white and green dice, respectively, represented different therapies for acute stroke. Overall, the ‘trials’ showed no significant benefit from the three therapies. However, the simulation of a number of perfectly plausible events in the process of meta‐analysis – such as the exclusion of several of the ‘negative’ trials through publication bias (see Chapter 3 ‘Randomised controlled trials’), a subgroup analysis that excluded data on red dice therapy (because, on looking back at the results, red dice appeared to be harmful) and other, essentially arbitrary, exclusions on the grounds of ‘methodological quality’ – led to an apparently highly significant benefit of ‘dice therapy’ in acute stroke. You cannot, of course, cure anyone of a stroke by rolling a dice, but if these simulated results pertained to a genuine medical controversy (such as which postmenopausal women would be best advised to take hormone replacement therapy or whether breech babies should routinely be delivered by caesarean section), how would you spot these subtle biases? The answer is you need to work through the what‐ifs. What if the authors of the systematic review had
---
# Chapter 9

Changed the inclusion criteria? What if they had excluded unpublished studies? What if their ‘quality weightings’ had been assigned differently? What if trials of lower methodological quality had been included (or excluded)? What if all the unaccounted-for patients in a trial were assumed to have died (or been cured)?

An exploration of what-ifs is known as a sensitivity analysis. If you find that fiddling with the data like this in various ways makes little or no difference to the review’s overall results, you can assume that the review’s conclusions are relatively robust. If, however, the key findings disappear when any of the what-ifs changes, the conclusions should be expressed far more cautiously and you should hesitate before changing your practice in the light of them. For more on sensitivity analysis, see the Cochrane Handbook.

Question Five: Have the numerical results been interpreted with common sense and due regard to the broader aspects of the problem?

As the next section shows, it is easy to be fazed by the figures and graphs in a systematic review. But any numerical result, however precise, accurate, ‘significant’ or otherwise incontrovertible, must be placed in the context of the painfully simple and (often) frustratingly general question that the review addressed. The clinician must decide how (if at all) this numerical result, whether significant or not, should influence the care of an individual patient.

A particularly important feature to consider when undertaking or appraising a systematic review is the external validity of included trials (Box 9.3). A trial may be of high methodological quality and have a precise and numerically impressive result, but it may, for example, have been conducted on participants under the age of 60, and hence may not apply at all to people over 75.

|Box 9.3|Assigning weight to trials in a systematic review|
|---|---|
|Each trial should be evaluated in terms of its:| |
|Methodological quality – that is, extent to which the design and conduct are likely to have prevented systematic errors (bias) (see Chapter 4 ‘Was bias avoided or minimised?’);| |
|Precision – that is, a measure of the likelihood of random errors (usually depicted as the width of the confidence interval around the result);| |
|External validity – that is, the extent to which the results are generalisable or applicable to a particular target population.| |
|(Additional aspects of ‘quality’ such as scientific importance, clinical importance and literary quality are rightly given great weight by peer reviewers and journal editors, but are less relevant to the systematic reviewer once the question to be addressed has been defined.)| |

for good physiological reasons. The inclusion in systematic reviews of irrelevant studies is guaranteed to lead to absurdities and reduce the credibility of secondary research.

# Meta‐analysis for the non‐statistician

If I had to pick one term that exemplifies the fear and loathing felt by so many students, clinicians and consumers towards evidence‐based healthcare, that word would be ‘meta‐analysis’. The meta‐analysis, defined as a statistical synthesis of the numerical results of several trials that all addressed the same question, is the statisticians’ chance to pull a double whammy on you. First, they frighten you with all the statistical tests in the individual papers, and then they use a whole new battery of tests to produce a new set of odds ratios, confidence intervals and values for significance.

As I confessed in Chapter 5, I too tend to go into panic mode at the sight of ratios, square root signs and half‐forgotten Greek letters. But before you consign meta‐analysis to the set of specialised techniques that you will never understand, remember two things. First, the meta‐analyst may wear an anorak but he or she is on your side. A good meta‐analysis is often easier for the non‐statistician to understand than the stack of primary research papers from which it was derived, for reasons I am about to explain. Second, the underlying statistical principles used for meta‐analysis are the same as the ones for any other data analysis – it’s just that some of the numbers are bigger.

# Chapter 9

The first task of the meta‐analyst, after following the preliminary steps for systematic review in Figure 9.1, is to decide which out of all the various outcome measures chosen by the authors of the primary studies is the best one (or ones) to use in the overall synthesis. In trials of a particular chemotherapy regimen for pancreatic cancer, for example, some authors will have published cumulative mortality figures (i.e. the total number of people who have died to date) at cutoff points of 3 and 12 months, whereas other trials will have published 6‐month, 12‐month and 5‐year cumulative mortality. The meta‐analyst might decide to concentrate on 12‐month mortality because this result can be easily extracted from all the papers. He or she may, however, decide that 3‐month mortality is a clinically important end‐point, and would need to write to the authors of the remaining trials asking for the raw data from which to calculate these figures.

In addition to crunching the numbers, part of the meta‐analyst’s job description is to tabulate relevant information on the inclusion criteria, sample size, baseline patient characteristics, withdrawal (‘dropout’) rate and results of primary and secondary end‐points of all the studies included. If this task has been performed properly, you will be able to compare both the methods and the results of several trials whose authors wrote up their research in

Different ways. Although such tables are often visually daunting, they save you having to plough through the methods sections of each paper and compare one author’s tabulated results with another author’s pie chart or histogram.

These days, the results of meta‐analyses tend to be presented in a fairly standard form. This is partly because meta‐analysts often use computer software to do the calculations for them (see the latest edition of the Cochrane Reviewers’ Handbook for an up‐to‐date menu of options [8]), and most such software packages include a standard graphics tool that presents results as illustrated in Figure 9.2. I have reproduced (with the authors’ permission) this pictorial representation (colloquially known as a forest plot or blobbo-gram) of the pooled odds ratios of eight randomised controlled trials of therapy for depression. Each of these eight studies had compared a group receiving cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with a control group that received no active treatment and in whom pharmacotherapy (PHA – i.e. drug treatment) was discontinued [16]. The primary (main) outcome in this meta‐analysis was relapse within 1 year.

The eight trials, each represented by the surname of the first author and the year that paper was published (e.g. ‘Blackburn 1986’) are listed, one below the other on the left‐hand side of the figure. The horizontal line corresponding to each trial shows the likelihood of relapse by 1 year in patients randomised to CBT compared to patients randomised to PHA. The ‘blob’ in the middle of each line is the point estimate of the difference between the groups (the best single estimate of the benefit in improved relapse rate by offering CBT rather than PHA), and the width of the line represents the 95% confidence interval

of this estimate (see Chapter 5 ‘Have confidence intervals been calculated, and do the authors’ conclusions reflect them?’). The key vertical line to look at, known as the line of no effect, is the one marking the relative risk (RR) of 1.0. Note that if the horizontal line for any trial does not cross the line of no effect, there is a 95% chance that there is a ‘real’ difference between the groups. As I argued in Chapter 5, if the confidence interval of the result (the horizontal line) does cross the line of no effect (i.e. the vertical line at RR = 1.0), which can mean either that there is no significant difference between the treatments, and/or that the sample size was too small to allow us to be confident where the true result lies. The various individual studies give point estimates of the odds ratio of CBT compared to PHA (of between 0.5 and 9.6), and the confidence intervals of some studies are so wide that they don’t even fit on the graph.

Now, here comes the fun of meta‐analysis. Look at the tiny diamond below all the horizontal lines. This represents the pooled data from all eight trials (overall RR CBT : PHA = 2.61, meaning that CBT has 2.61 times the odds of preventing relapse), with a new, much narrower, confidence interval of this RR (1.58–4.31). Because the diamond does not overlap the line of no effect, we can say that there is a statistically significant difference between the two treatments in terms of the primary end‐point (relapse of depression in the first year). Now, in this example, seven of the eight trials suggested a benefit Chapter 9 from CBT, but in none of them was the sample size large enough for that finding to be statistically significant.

Note, however, that this neat little diamond does not mean that you should offer CBT to every patient with depression. It has a much more limited meaning – that the average patient in the trials presented in this meta‐analysis is likely to benefit in terms of the primary outcome (relapse of depression within a year) if they receive CBT. The choice of treatment should, of course, take into account how the patient feels about embarking on a course of CBT (see Chapter 16) and also on the relative merits of this therapy compared with other treatments for depression. The paper from which Figure 9.2 is taken also described a second meta‐analysis that showed no significant difference between CBT and continuing antidepressant therapy, suggesting, perhaps, that patients who prefer not to have CBT may do just as well by continuing to take their tablets [16].

As this example shows, ‘non‐significant’ trials (i.e. ones that, on their own, did not demonstrate a significant difference between treatment and control groups) often make an important contribution to a pooled result in a meta‐analysis that is statistically significant. The most famous example of this, which the Cochrane Collaboration adopted as its logo (Figure 9.3), is the meta‐analysis of seven trials of the effect of giving steroids to mothers who were expected to give birth prematurely [17]. Only two of the seven trials

showed a statistically significant benefit (in terms of survival of the infant), but the improvement in precision (i.e. the narrowing of confidence intervals) in the pooled results, shown by the narrower width of the diamond compared with the individual lines, demonstrates the strength of the evidence in favour of this intervention. This meta‐analysis showed that infants of steroid‐treated mothers were 30–50% less likely to die than infants of control mothers.

You may have worked out by now that anyone who is thinking about doing a clinical trial of an intervention should first do a systematic review, with a meta‐analysis if possible, of all the previous trials on that same intervention. In practice, researchers only occasionally do this [18]. This was graphically illustrated a few years ago when Dean Fergusson and colleagues of the Ottawa Health Research Institute published a cumulative meta‐analysis of all ran‐domised controlled trials carried out on the drug aprotinin in peri‐operative bleeding during cardiac surgery [19]. They lined up the trials in the order they had been published, and worked out what a meta‐analysis of ‘all trials done so far’ would have shown (had it been performed at the time). The resulting cumulative meta‐analysis had shocking news for the research communities. The beneficial effect of aprotinin reached statistical significance after only 12 trials – that is, back in 1992. But, because nobody did a meta‐analysis at the time, a further 52 clinical trials were undertaken (and more may be ongoing). All these trials were scientifically unnecessary and hence, strictly speaking, unethical (because half the patients were denied a drug that had been proved to improve outcome). Figure 9.4 illustrates this waste of effort.

If you have followed the arguments on meta‐analysis of published trial results this far, you might like to read up on the more sophisticated technique of meta‐analysis of individual patient data, which provides a more accurate and precise figure for the point estimate of effect [20].

Explaining heterogeneity

In everyday language, ‘homogeneous’ means ‘of uniform composition’, and ‘heterogeneous’ means ‘many different ingredients’. In the language of meta‐analysis, homogeneity means that the results of each individual trial are compatible with the results of any of the others. Homogeneity can be estimated at a glance once the trial results have been presented in the format illustrated in Figures 9.2 and 9.5. In Figure 9.2, the lower confidence interval of every trial is below the upper confidence interval of all the others (i.e. the horizontal lines all overlap to some extent). Statistically speaking, the trials are homogeneous. Conversely, in Figure 9.4, there are some trials whose lower confidence interval is above the upper confidence interval of one or more other trials (i.e. some lines do not overlap at all). These trials may be said to be heterogeneous.

You may have spotted by now that declaring a set of trials heterogeneous on the basis of whether their confidence intervals overlap is somewhat arbitrary, as the confidence interval itself is arbitrary (it can be set at 90%, 95%, 99% or indeed any other value). The definitive test involves a slightly more

sophisticated statistical manoeuvre than holding a ruler up against the blob- bogram. The one most commonly used is a variant of the Chi‐square (χ2) test (see Table 5.1), as the question addressed is, ‘is there greater variation between the results of the trials than is compatible with the play of chance?’. The χ2 statistic for heterogeneity is explained in more detail by Thompson [21], who offers the following useful rule of thumb: a χ2 statistic has, on aver- age, a value equal to its degrees of freedom (in this case, the number of trials in the meta‐analysis minus one), so a χ2 of 7.0 for a set of eight trials would provide no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. (In fact, it would not prove that the trials were homogeneous either, particularly because the χ2 test has low power (see Chapter 4 ‘Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?’) to detect small but important levels of heterogeneity.) A χ2 value much greater than the number of trials in a meta‐analysis tells us that the trials that contributed to the analysis are different in some impor- tant way from one another. There may, for example, be known differences in method (e.g. authors may have used different questionnaires to assess the symptoms of depression), or known clinical differences in the trial partici- pants (e.g. one centre might have been a tertiary referral hospital to which all the sickest patients were referred). There may, however, be unknown or unrecorded differences between the trials which the meta‐analyst can only speculate upon until he or she has extracted further details from the trials’ Chapter 9 authors. Remember: demonstrating statistical heterogeneity is a mathemati- cal exercise and is the job of the statistician, but explaining this heterogeneity (i.e. looking for, and accounting for, clinical heterogeneity) is an interpretive exercise and requires imagination, common sense and hands‐on clinical or research experience.

Figure 9.5, which is reproduced with permission from Thompson’s [21] chapter on the subject, shows the results of ten trials of cholesterol‐lowering strategies. The results are expressed as the percentage reduction in heart dis- ease risk associated with each 0.6 mmol/l reduction in serum cholesterol level. The horizontal lines represent the 95% confidence intervals of each result, and it is clear, even without being told the χ2 statistic of 127, that the trials are highly heterogeneous. To simply ‘average out’ the results of the trials in Figure 9.5 would be very misleading. The meta‐analyst must return to his or her primary sources and ask, ‘in what way was trial A different from trial B, and what do trials E, F and H have in common which makes their results cluster at one extreme of the figure?’ In this example, a correction for the age of the trial participants reduced χ2 from 127 to 45. In other words, most of the ‘incompatibility’ in the results of these trials can be explained by the fact that embarking on a strategy (such as a special diet) that successfully reduces your cholesterol level will be substantially more likely to prevent a heart attack if you are 45 than if you are 85.

This, essentially, is the essence of the grievance of Hans Eysenck [22], who has constructed a vigorous and entertaining critique of the science of meta‐analysis. In a world of lumpers and splitters, Eysenck is a splitter, and it offends his sense of the qualitative and the particular (see Chapter 12) to combine the results of studies that were performed on different populations in different places at different times and for different reasons.

Eysenck’s reservations about meta‐analysis are borne out in the infamously discredited meta‐analysis that demonstrated (wrongly) that there was significant benefit to be had from giving intravenous magnesium to heart attack victims. A subsequent megatrial involving 58 000 patients (ISIS‐4) failed to find any benefit whatsoever, and the meta‐analysts’ misleading conclusions were subsequently explained in terms of publication bias, methodological weaknesses in the smaller trials and clinical heterogeneity [23,24]. (Incidentally, for more debate on the pros and cons of meta‐analysis versus megatrials, see this paper [25].)

Eysenck’s mathematical naiveté is embarrassing (‘if a medical treatment has an effect so recondite and obscure as to require a meta‐analysis to establish it, I would not be happy to have it used on me’), which is perhaps why the editors of the second edition of the Systematic Reviews book dropped his chapter from their collection. But I have a great deal of sympathy for the principle of his argument. As one who tends to side with the splitters, I would put Eysenck’s misgivings about meta‐analysis high on the list of required reading for the aspiring systematic reviewer. Indeed, I once threw my own hat into the ring when Griffin [26] published a meta‐analysis of primary studies into the management of diabetes by primary health care teams. Although I have a high regard for Griffin as a scientist, I felt strongly that he had not been justified in performing a mathematical summation of what I believed were very different studies all addressing slightly different questions. As I said in my commentary on his article, ‘four apples and five oranges make four apples and five oranges, not nine apple and oranges’ [27]. But Simon numbers himself among the lumpers, and there are plenty of people cleverer than I who have argued that he was entirely correct to analyse his data as he did. Fortunately, the two of us have agreed to differ – and on a personal level we remain friends.

New approaches to systematic review

This chapter has addressed the most commonly used approach to systematic review – synthesising trials of therapy. If you’re comfortable with that, you might like to start exploring the literature on more challenging forms of systematic review – such as diagnostic studies [28], and the emerging science

of systematic review of qualitative research, for which a brand‐new series was published in 2018 in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology [29–34], and the enticing idea of ‘living systematic reviews’ (a sort of wiki approach in which the review is never declared finished but placed on the Internet and updated in an ongoing way) [35]. See also my brief mention of rapid systematic reviews under Question Four.

For my own part, I’ve been working with colleagues to develop new approaches to systematic review, known as realist and meta‐narrative review [36,37], which highlight and explore (rather than attempt to ‘average out’) the fundamental differences between primary studies – an approach that I think is particularly useful for developing systematic reviews in healthcare policymaking. But these relatively small‐print applications are all beyond the basics, and if you’re reading this book to get you through an exam, you’ll probably find they aren’t on the syllabus.

If you found yourself sympathising with Eysenck in the previous section, you might like to look at some other theoretical critiques of systematic review. I recently coauthored a paper arguing for the advantages of narrative review over conventional systematic review – especially when the key task is to illuminate and make sense of the literature on a very broad topic area (as opposed to synthesising data on a very narrow topic) [38]. But while I stand by that editorial, we shouldn’t throw the baby out with the bath water.

# Chapter 10 Papers that tell you what to do (guidelines)

The great guidelines debate

Never was the chasm between front-line clinicians and back-room policymakers wider than in their respective attitudes to clinical guidelines. Policymakers (by which I include everyone who has a view on how medicine ought to be practised in an ideal world - including politicians, senior managers, clinical directors, academics and teachers) tend to love guidelines. Some front-line clinicians (i.e. people who spend all their time seeing patients) have a strong aversion to guidelines.

Before we carry this political hot potato any further, we need a definition of guidelines, for which the following will suffice.

Guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner decisions about appropriate healthcare for specific clinical circumstances.

A great paper on evidence-based guidelines (what they are, how they're developed, why we need them and what the controversies are) was written by one of my ex PhD students, Deborah Swinglehurst [1]. I have drawn extensively on her review when updating this chapter. An important distinction Deborah makes in her paper is between guidelines (which are usually expressed in terms of general principles and leave room for judgement within broad parameters) and protocols, which she defines as: 'Protocols are instructions on what to do in particular circumstances. They are similar to guidelines but include less room for individual judgement, are often produced for less experienced staff, or for use in situations where eventualities are predictable.'

# Chapter 10

|Box 10.1|Purpose of guidelines|
|---|---|
|1|To make evidence-based standards explicit and accessible (but see subsequent text: few guidelines currently in circulation are truly evidence-based).|
|2|To make decision making in the clinic and at the bedside easier and more objective.|
|3|To provide a yardstick for assessing professional performance.|
|4|To delineate the division of labour (e.g. between general practitioners (GPs) and consultants).|
|5|To educate patients and professionals about current best practice.|
|6|To improve the cost-effectiveness of health services and reduce waste.|
|7|To serve as a tool for external control.|

The purposes that guidelines serve are given in Box 10.1. Clinician resistance to guidelines has a number of explanations:

- Clinical freedom ('I'm not having anyone telling me how to manage my patients')
- Debates amongst experts about the quality of evidence ('Well, if they can't agree among themselves ...')
- Lack of appreciation of evidence by practitioners ('That's all very well, but when I trained we were always taught to hold back on steroids for asthma')
- Defensive medicine ('I'll check all the tests anyway - belt and braces')
- Strategic and cost constraints ('We can't afford to replace the equipment')
- Specific practical constraints ('Where on earth did I put those guidelines?')
- Reluctance of patients to accept procedures ('Mrs Brown insists she needs a cervical smear every year')
- Competing influences of other non-medical factors ('When we get the new computer system up and running...')
- Lack of appropriate, patient-specific feedback on performance ('I seem to be treating this condition OK')
- Confusion ('The guideline doesn't seem to help me with the problem I'm facing')

The image of the medical buffoon blundering blithely through the outpatient clinic still diagnosing the same illnesses and prescribing the same drugs he or she learnt about at medical school 40 years previously, and never having read a paper since, knocks the 'clinical freedom' argument right out of the arena. Such hypothetical situations are grist to the mill of those who would impose 'expert guidelines' on most, if not all, medical practice and hold to account all those who fail to keep in step.

# Papers that tell you what to do (guidelines)

But the counter argument to the excessive use, and particularly the compulsive imposition, of clinical guidelines is a powerful one, and it was expressed very eloquently some years ago by the late Sir John Grimley Evans [2].

There is a fear that in the absence of evidence clearly applicable to the case in the hand a clinician might be forced by guidelines to make use of evidence which is only doubtfully relevant, generated perhaps in a different grouping of patients in another country at some other time and using a similar but not identical treatment. This is evidence‐biased medicine; it is to use evidence in the manner of the fabled drunkard who searched under the street lamp for his door key because that is where the light was, even though he had dropped the key somewhere else.

Grimley Evans’ fear, which every practising clinician shares but few can articulate, is that politicians and health service managers who have jumped on the evidence‐based medicine (EBM) bandwagon will use guidelines to decree the treatment of diseases rather than of patients. They will, it is feared, make judgements about people and their illnesses subservient to published evidence that an intervention is effective ‘on average’ (this happened to me a few years ago; I wrote about it here [3]). This, and other real and perceived disadvantages of guidelines, are given in Box 10.2 [2]. But if you read the

**Box 10.2 Drawbacks of guidelines (real and perceived) Chapter 10**
|1|Guidelines may be intellectually suspect and reflect ‘expert opinion’, which may formalise unsound practice.|
|---|---|
|2|By reducing medical practice variation they may standardise to ‘average’ rather than best practice.|
|3|They might inhibit innovation and prevent individual cases from being dealt with discretely and sensitively.|
|4|Guidelines developed at national or regional level may not reflect local needs or have the ‘ownership’ of local practitioners.|
|5|Guidelines developed in secondary care may not reflect demographic, clinical or practical differences between this setting and the primary care setting.|
|6|Guidelines may produce undesirable shifts in the balance of power between different professional groups (e.g. between clinicians and academics or purchasers and providers). Hence, guideline development may be perceived as a political act.|
|7|Out‐of‐date guidelines might hold back the implementation of new research evidence.|

# Chapter 10

How to read a paper

Above-mentioned distinction between guidelines and protocols, you will probably have realized that a good guideline wouldn’t force you to abandon common sense or judgment – it would simply flag up a recommended course of action for you to consider.

Nevertheless, even a perfect guideline can make work for the busy clinician. My friend Neal Maskrey sent me this quote from an article in The Lancet.

We surveyed one [24-h] acute medical take in our hospital. In a relatively quiet take, we saw 18 patients with a total of 44 diagnoses. The guidelines that the on-call physician should have read, remembered and applied correctly for those conditions came to 3679 pages. This number included only NICE [UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence], the Royal Colleges and major societies from the last 3 years. If it takes 2 min to read each page, the physician on call will have to spend 122 h reading to keep abreast of the guidelines.

The mushrooming guidelines industry owes its success at least in part to a growing ‘accountability culture’ that is now (many argue) being set in statute in many countries. In the UK National Health Service, all doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health professions have a contractual duty to provide clinical care based on best available research evidence. Officially produced or sanctioned guidelines – such as those produced by the UK NICE (www.nice.org.uk) are a way of both supporting and policing that laudable goal. While the medicolegal implications of ‘official’ guidelines have rarely been tested in the UK, courts outside the UK have ruled that guideline developers can be held liable for faulty guidelines. A few years ago, a US court refused to accept adherence to an evidence-based guideline (which advised doctors to share the inherent uncertainty associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in asymptomatic middle-aged men, and make a shared decision on whether the test was worth doing) as defense by a doctor being sued for missing an early prostate cancer in an unlucky 53-year-old man. Partly on the basis of that court case, the guidelines were initially altered (which greatly increased the number of PSA tests done on asymptomatic men, as well as the amount of anxiety and further tests, all with low yield). The author of the original article spent the next 10 years fighting to put the evidence back into the evidence-based guideline – and he recently published a follow-up paper to announce that he had ‘won’.

For a more detailed review of the topic of guideline adherence, see my book How to Implement Evidence-Based Healthcare, where I review different approaches to influencing clinician behavior and also different theoretical

# Papers that tell you what to do (guidelines)

Models of change [7]. The remainder of this chapter addresses what to do with a guideline if you want to evaluate it (that is, decide on its validity and relevance) with a view to using it in practice.

# Ten questions to ask about a clinical guideline

Deborah Swinglehurst [1] rightly points out that all the song and dance about encouraging clinicians to follow guidelines is only justified if the guideline is worth following in the first place. Sadly, not all of them are. She suggests two aspects of a good guideline – the content (e.g. whether it is based on a comprehensive and rigorous systematic review of the evidence) and the process (how the guideline was put together). I would add a third aspect – the presentation of the guideline (how appealing it is to the busy clinician and how easy it is to follow).

Like all published articles, guidelines would be easier to evaluate on all these counts if they were presented in a standardized format, and an international standard (the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument) for developing, reporting and presenting guidelines was recently published [8]. Box 10.3 offers a pragmatic checklist, based partly on the work of the AGREE group, for structuring your assessment of a clinical guideline; Box 10.4 reproduces the revised AGREE criteria

Outline framework for assessing a clinical guideline (see Chapter 10 also Appendix 1)
Objective: pe primary objective of pe guideline, including pe healp problem and pe targeted patients, providers and settings.
Options: pe clinical practice options considered in formulating pe guideline.
Outcomes: significant healp and economic outcomes considered in comparing alternative practices.
Evidence: how and when evidence was gapered, selected and synpesized.
Values: disclosure of how values were assigned to potential outcomes of practice options and who participated in pe process.
Benefits, harms and costs: pe type and magnitude of benefits, harms and costs expected for patients from guideline implementation.
Recommendations: summary of key recommendations.
Validation: report of any external review, comparison wip oper guidelines or clinical testing of guideline use.
Sponsors and stakeholders: disclosure of pe persons who developed, funded or endorsed pe guideline.

# Papers that tell you what to do (guidelines)

in full. Because few published guidelines currently follow such a format, you will probably have to scan the full text for answers to the questions given here. In preparing this list I have drawn on many of the other articles referenced in this chapter as well as the relatively new AGREE instrument.

# Question One: Did the preparation and publication of this guideline involve a significant conflict of interest?

I will resist labouring the point, but a drug company that makes hormone replacement therapy or a research professor whose life’s work has been spent perfecting this treatment might be tempted to recommend it for wider indications than the average clinician. Much has been written about the ‘medicalisation’ of human experience (are energetic children with a short attention span ‘hyperactive’; should women with low sex drive be offered ‘treatment’, etc.). A guideline may be evidence-based, but the problem it addresses will have been constructed by a team that views the world in a particular way.

# Question Two: Is the guideline concerned with an appropriate topic, and does it state clearly the target group it applies to?

Key questions in relation to choice of topic, reproduced from an article published a few years ago in the British Medical Journal [9], are given in Box 10.5. The Grimley Evans quote mentioned earlier begs the question ‘To whom does this guideline apply?’ If the evidence related to people aged 18–65 with no comorbidity (i.e. with nothing else wrong with them except the disease being considered), it might not apply to your patient. Sometimes this means you will need to reject it outright, but, more commonly, you will have to exercise your judgement in assessing its transferability.

Key questions on choice of topic for guideline development
Is pe topic high volume, high risk and high cost?
Are pere large or unexplained variations in practice?
Is pe topic important in terms of pe process and outcome of patient care?
Is pere potential for improvement?
Is pe investment of time and money likely to be repaid?
Is pe topic likely to hold pe interest of team members?
Is consensus likely?
Will change benefit patients?
Can change be implemented?

# Chapter 10

Question Three: Did pe guideline development panel include (i) an expert in pe topic area; (ii) a specialist in pe mepods of secondary research (e.g. meta‐analyst, healp economist); and (iii) a person affected by pe condition?
If a clinical guideline has been prepared entirely by a panel of internal ‘experts’, you should, paradoxically, look at it particularly critically as researchers have been shown to be less objective in appraising evidence in peir own field of expertise pan in someone else’s. The involvement of an outsider (an expert in guideline development raper pan in pe particular clinical topic) to act as arbiter and mepodological adviser should make pe process more objective. But as Gabbay and his team [10] showed in an elegant qualitative study, pe hard‐to‐measure expertise (what might be called embodied knowledge) of front‐line clinicians (in pis case, GPs) contributed crucially to pe development of workable local guidelines. Since pen, pere has been much research into pis somewhat elusive topic (see a systematic review by my own team [11]). But clinical experience and wisdom don’t bring pe knowledge of what it’s like to have pe condition in question yourself, and emerging evidence suggests pat patients and carers bring a crucial pird perspective to pe guideline development process [12].

Question Four: Have pe subjective judgements of pe development panel been made explicit, and are pey justified?
Guideline development is not just a technical process of finding evidence, appraising it and turning it into recommendations. Recommendations also require judgements (relating to personal or social values, epical principles, etc.). As pe UK NICE has stated (see www.nice.org.uk), it is right and proper for guideline developers to take account of pe ‘epical principles, preferences, culture and aspirations pat should underpin pe nature and extent of care provided by pe National Healp Service’. Swinglehurst [1] suggests four sub‐questions to ask about pese subjective judgements:

1. What guiding principles have been used to decide how effective an intervention must be (compared with its potential harms) before its recommendation is considered?
2. What values have underpinned the panel’s decisions about which guideline developments to prioritise?
3. What is the ethical framework to which guideline developers are working – in particular relating to matters of distributive justice ('rationing')?
4. Where there was disagreement between guideline developers, what explicit processes have been used to resolve such disagreements?
---
# Question Five: Have all the relevant data been scrutinised and rigorously evaluated?

The academic validity of guidelines depends (among other things) on whether they are supported by high‐quality primary research studies, and on how strong the evidence from those studies is. At the most basic level, was the literature analysed at all, or are these guidelines simply a statement of the preferred practice of a selected panel of experts (i.e. consensus guidelines)? If the literature was looked at, was a systematic search performed and, if so, did it broadly follow the method described in Chapter 9 ‘Evaluating systematic reviews’? Were all papers unearthed by the search included, or was an explicit scoring system (such as GRADE [13]) used to reject those of poor methodological quality and give those of high quality the extra weight they deserved?

Up‐to‐date systematic reviews should ideally be the raw material for guideline development. But, in many cases, a search for rigorous and relevant research on which to base guidelines proves fruitless, and the authors, unavoidably, resort to ‘best available’ evidence or expert opinion.

# Question Six: Has the evidence been properly synthesised, and are the guideline’s conclusions in keeping with the data on which they are based?

Another key determinant of the validity of a guideline is how the different studies contributing to it have been pulled together (that is, synthesised) in the context of the clinical and policy needs being addressed. For one thing, a systematic review and meta‐analysis might have been appropriate, and if the latter, issues of probability and confidence should have been dealt with acceptably.

But systematic reviews don’t exist (and never will exist) to cover every eventuality in clinical decision‐making and policymaking. In many areas, especially complex ones, the opinion of experts is still the best ‘evidence’ around, and in such cases guideline developers should adopt rigorous methods to ensure that it isn’t just the voice of the expert who talks for longest in the meetings that drives the recommendations. Formal guideline development groups usually have an explicit set of methods – see, for example, this paper from the UK NICE [14].

A recent analysis of three ‘evidence‐based’ guidelines for obstructive sleep apnoea found that they made very different recommendations despite being based on an almost identical set of primary studies. The main reason for the discrepancy was that experts tended to rank studies from their own country more highly [15]!

# Question Seven: Does the guideline address variations in medical practice and other controversial areas (e.g. optimum care in response to genuine or perceived underfunding)?
---
# Chapter 10

How to read a paper

It would be foolish to make dogmatic statements about ideal practice without reference to what actually goes on in the real world. There are many instances where some practitioners are marching to an altogether different tune from the rest of us, and a good guideline should face such realities head on rather than hoping that the misguided minority will fall into step by default. Another thorny issue that guidelines should tackle head on is where essential compromises should be made if financial constraints preclude ‘ideal’ practice. If the ideal, for example, is to offer all patients with significant coronary artery disease a bypass operation (at the time of writing it isn’t, but never mind), and the health service can only afford to fund 20% of such procedures, who should be pushed to the front of the queue?

Question Eight: Is the guideline clinically relevant, comprehensive and flexible? In other words, is it written from the perspective of the practising doctor, nurse, midwife, physiotherapist, and so on, and does it take account of the type of patients he or she is likely to see, and in what circumstances? Perhaps the most frequent source of trouble here is when guidelines developed in secondary care and intended for use in hospital outpatients (who tend to be at the sicker end of the clinical spectrum) are passed on to the primary healthcare team with the intention of their being used in the primary care setting, where, in general, patients are less ill and may well need fewer investigations and less aggressive management. This issue is discussed in Chapter 8 ‘Validating diagnostic tests against a gold standard’ in relation to the different utilities of diagnostic and screening tests in different populations.

Guidelines should cover all, or most, clinical eventualities. What if the patient is intolerant of the recommended medication? What if you can’t send off all the recommended blood tests? What if the patient is very young, very old, or has a coexisting illness? These, after all, are the patients who prompt most of us to reach for our guidelines; while the more ‘typical’ patient tends to be managed without recourse to written instructions. Bruce Guthrie and his team have done great work to address the challenge of developing guidelines for people with multi-morbidity [16]. Be warned, however, that this is to some extent a circle that can’t be squared. Glyn Elwyn, Sietse Wieringa and I have recently written ‘Clinical encounters in the post‐guidelines era’, a paper that discusses the increasing complexity and uniqueness of many clinical decisions. In such circumstances, selecting and using a guideline will inevitably involve a great deal of situational judgement and negotiation with the patient [17].

Flexibility is a particularly important consideration for national and regional bodies who set themselves up to develop guidelines. As noted earlier, ownership of guidelines by the people who are intended to use them

# Papers that tell you what to do (guidelines)

Question Nine: Does the guideline take into account what is acceptable to, affordable by and practically possible for patients?

There is an apocryphal story of a physician in the 1940s (a time when no effective medicines for high blood pressure were available), who discovered that restricting the diet of hypertensive patients to plain boiled unsalted rice dramatically reduced their blood pressure and also reduced the risk of stroke. The story goes, however, that the diet made the patients so miserable that many of them committed suicide. This is an extreme example, but within the past few years I have seen guidelines for treating constipation in the elderly that offered no alternative to the combined insults of large amounts of bran and twice-daily suppositories. Small wonder that the district nurses who were issued with them (for whom I have a good deal of respect) have gone back to giving castor oil. For a further discussion on how to incorporate the needs and priorities of patients in guideline development, see the review by Boivin et al. [12].

Question Ten: Does the guideline include recommendations for its own dissemination, implementation and regular review?

Given the well-documented gap between what is known to be good practice and what actually happens, and the many barriers to the successful implementation of guidelines, it would be in the interests of those who develop guidelines to suggest methods of maximizing their use. If this objective were included as standard in the ‘Guidelines for good guidelines’, the guideline writers’ output would probably include fewer ivory tower recommendations and more that are plausible, possible and capable of being explained to patients. Having said that, one very positive development in EBHC since I wrote the first edition of this book is the change in guideline developers’ attitudes: they now often take responsibility for linking their outputs to clinicians (and patients) in the real world and for reviewing and updating their recommendations periodically.

1. Take a look at the ‘Guidance’ page of the NICE website (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance). Alternatively (as links can change after a book is published), put ‘NICE guidelines’ into Google and work your way to the relevant page. Browse the list of recently added guidelines. You will find that they are typically very long. Look at the recommendations – but also at the

Underpinning evidence (this may be in appendices). Finally, look at the account of how the guideline was produced. To what extent do you trust it after answering all those questions?

1. Find your way to the TRIP database (www.tripdatabase.com or put ‘TRIP database’ into Google). Put a topic (say ‘PSA testing’) into the search engine. Now, on the right‐hand side of the screen, find the header ‘Guidelines’. You should see a list of different guidelines produced from around the world. Use the questions in this chapter to guide you as you compare and contrast two or more of these guidelines. Can you explain instances when they recommend different courses of action? Is one guideline scientifically better than another – or can the differences be explained by differences in setting and application?

# Chapter 11 Papers that tell you what things cost (economic analyses)

What is economic analysis? An economic analysis can be defined as one that involves the use of analytical techniques to define choices in resource allocation (in other words, help us choose how to spend our money). Most of what I have to say on this subject comes from advice prepared some years ago by Michael Drummond’s team. Drummond has extended and updated this advice in a recent book. Both these sources emphasise the importance of setting the economic questions about a paper in the context of the overall quality and relevance of the study (see section ‘Ten questions to ask about an economic analysis’).

The first economic evaluation I ever remember was a TV advertisement in which the pop singer Cliff Richard tried to persuade a housewife that the most expensive brand of washing-up liquid on the market ‘actually works out cheaper’. It was, apparently, stronger on stains, softer on the hands and produced more bubbles per penny than ‘a typical cheap liquid’. Although I was only nine at the time, I was unconvinced. Which ‘typical cheap liquid’ was the product being compared with? How much stronger on stains was it? Why should the effectiveness of a washing-up liquid be measured in terms of bubbles produced rather than plates cleaned?

Forgive me for sticking with this trivial example, but I’d like to use it to illustrate the four main types of economic evaluation that you will find in the literature (see Table 11.1 for the conventional definitions).

|Type of analysis|Outcome measure|Conditions of use|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cost‐minimisation analysis|No outcome measure|Used when the effect of both interventions is known (or may be assumed) to be identical|Comparing the price of a brand name drug with that of its generic equivalent if bioequivalence has been demonstrated|
|Cost‐effectiveness analysis|Natural units (e.g. life‐years gained)|Used when the effect of the interventions can be expressed in terms of one main variable|Comparing two preventive treatments for an otherwise fatal condition|
|Cost–utility analysis|Utility units (e.g. quality‐adjusted life‐years)|Used when the effect of the interventions on health status has two or more important dimensions (e.g. benefits and side effects of drugs)|Comparing the benefits of two treatments for varicose veins in terms of surgical result, cosmetic appearance and risk of serious adverse event (e.g. pulmonary embolus)|
|Cost–benefit analysis|Monetary units (e.g. estimated cost of loss in productivity)|Used when it is desirable to compare an intervention for this condition with an intervention for a different condition|For a purchasing authority, to decide whether to fund a heart transplantation programme or a stroke rehabilitation ward|

and hand roughness caused by the liquid), “Sudso” provides 29 units per pound spent, whereas “Jiffo” provides 23 units.

Cost–benefit analysis: ‘The net overall cost (reflecting direct cost of the product, indirect cost of time spent washing up and estimated financial value of a clean plate relative to a slightly grubby one) of “Sudso” per day is 7.17p, while that of “Jiffo” is 9.32p.

You should be able to see immediately that the most sensible analysis to use in this example is cost‐effectiveness analysis. Cost‐minimisation analysis (Table 11.1) is inappropriate as ‘Sudso’ and ‘Jiffo’ do not have identical effectiveness. Cost–utility analysis is unnecessary because, in this example, we are interested in very little else apart from the number of plates cleaned per unit.

of washing-up liquid – in other words, our outcome has only one important dimension. Cost-benefit analysis is, in this example, an absurdly complicated way of telling you that ‘Sudso’ cleans more plates per penny.

However, there are many situations where health professionals, and others who purchase healthcare from real cash-limited budgets, must choose between interventions for a host of different conditions whose outcomes (such as cases of measles prevented, increased mobility after a hip replacement, reduced risk of death from heart attack or likelihood of giving birth to a live baby) cannot be directly compared with one another. Controversy surrounds not just how these comparisons should be made, but also who should make them, and to whom the decision-makers for the ‘rationing’ of healthcare should be accountable. These essential, fascinating and frustrating questions are beyond the scope of this book, but if you are interested I recommend the book by Donaldson and Mitton [3].

Measuring the costs and benefits of health interventions

A few years ago, I was taken to hospital to have my appendix removed. From the hospital’s point of view, the cost of my care included my board and lodging for 5 days, a proportion of doctors’ and nurses’ time, drugs and dressings and investigations (blood tests and a scan). Other direct costs included my GP’s time for attending to me in the middle of the night and the cost of the petrol my husband used when visiting me (not to mention the grapes and flowers).

In addition to this, there were the indirect costs of my loss in productivity. I was off work for 3 weeks, and my domestic duties were temporarily divided between various friends, neighbours and a nice young woman from a nanny agency. And, from my point of view, there were several intangible costs such as:

As discomfort, loss of independence, the allergic rash I developed on the medication and the cosmetically unsightly scar that I now carry on my abdomen.

As Table 11.2 shows, these direct, indirect and intangible costs constitute one side of the cost–benefit equation. On the benefit side, the operation greatly increased my chances of staying alive. In addition, I had a nice rest from work and, to be honest, I rather enjoyed all the attention and sympathy. Note that the social ‘stigma’ of appendicitis is relatively neutral, and indeed the social kudos of (say) a sports injury might even be positive. I would be less likely to view my hospital admission as bringing social benefit to me if it had been precipitated by, say, an epileptic fit or a psychotic episode, which have negative social stigmata.

In the appendicitis example, few patients would perceive much freedom of choice in deciding to opt for the operation (although I note in passing that non‐surgical management of appendicitis has been the subject of much research [4]). Most health interventions do not concern definitive procedures for acutely life‐threatening diseases. On the contrary, healthcare these days concerns what are sometimes referred to as ‘chronic non‐communicable diseases’ – incurable, progressive and (depending on how they wax and wane) ranging from inconvenient to downright disabling. Most of us can count on developing at least one such condition – for example, ischaemic heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, chronic bronchitis, cancer, rheumatism, prostatic hypertrophy or diabetes. At some stage, almost all of us will be forced to decide whether having a routine procedure or operation, taking a particular drug or making a compromise in our lifestyle (reducing our alcohol intake or sticking to a cholesterol‐lowering diet) is ‘worth it’. Chapter 11

It is fine for informed individuals to make choices about their own care by gut reaction (‘I’d rather live with my hernia than be cut open’, or ‘I know about the risk of thrombosis but I want to continue to smoke and stay on the [contraceptive] Pill’). But when the choices are about other people’s care, personal values and prejudices are the last thing that should enter the equation. Most of us would want the planners and policymakers to use objective, explicit and defensible criteria when making decisions such as, ‘No, Mrs Brown may not have a kidney transplant’.

One important way of addressing the ‘what’s it worth?’ question for a given health state (such as having poorly controlled diabetes or asthma) is to ask someone in that state how they feel. A number of questionnaires that attempt to measure overall health status, such as the Nottingham Health Profile, the Short Form (SF‐36) Health Survey Questionnaire (widely used in the UK) and the McMaster Health Utilities Index Questionnaire (popular in North America), have been developed. For an overview of these, see the textbook by McDowell et al. [5].

In some circumstances, disease-specific measures of well-being are more valid than general measures. For example, answering ‘yes’ to the question, ‘do you get very concerned about the food you are eating?’ might indicate anxiety in someone without diabetes but normal self-care attitudes in someone with diabetes. Hamoen and colleagues compared both generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life measures for men with prostate cancer, looking at a range of properties from the validity of the questions to how likely patients were to actually fill them in [6].

There has also been an upsurge of interest in patient-specific measures of quality of life, to allow patients to place values on particular aspects of their health and well-being. When quality of life is being analyzed from the point of view of the patient, this is a sensible and humane approach. However, the health economist tends to make decisions about groups of patients or populations, in which case patient-specific, and even disease-specific, measures of quality of life have limited relevance. If you would like to get up to speed in the ongoing debate on how to measure health-related quality of life, take time to look up some of the references listed at the end of this chapter [5,7–9].

The authors of standard instruments (such as the SF-36) for measuring health-related quality of life have often spent years ensuring they are valid (i.e. they measure what we think they are measuring), reliable (they do so every time) and responsive to change (i.e. if an intervention improves or worsens the patient’s health, the scale will reflect that). For this reason, you should be highly suspicious of a paper that eschews these standard instruments in favor of the authors’ own rough-and-ready scale. Note also that even instruments that have apparently been well validated often do not stand up to rigorous evaluation of their psychometric validity [9].

Another way of addressing the ‘what’s it worth?’ of particular health states is through health state preference values – that is, the value which, in a hypothetical situation, a healthy person would place on a particular deterioration in their health, or which a sick person would place on a return to health [10]. There are three main methods of assigning such values.

|Rating scale measurements:|The respondent is asked to make a mark on a fixed line, labelled, for example, ‘perfect health’ at one end and ‘death’ at the other, to indicate where he or she would place the state in question (e.g. being wheelchair-bound from arthritis of the hip).|
|---|---|
|Time trade-off measurements:|The respondent is asked to consider a particular health state (e.g. infertility) and estimate how many of their remaining years in full health they would sacrifice to be ‘cured’ of the condition.|
|Standard gamble measurements:|The respondent is asked to consider the choice between living for the rest of their life in a particular health state.|

and taking a ‘gamble’ (e.g. an operation) with a given odds of success, which would return them to full health if it succeeded but kill them if it failed. The odds are then varied to see at what point the respondent decides the gamble is not worth taking.

The quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY) can be calculated by multiplying the preference value for that state with the time the patient is likely to spend in that state. The results of cost–benefit analyses are usually expressed in terms of ‘cost per QALY’, some examples of which are shown in Box 11.1 [11–16]. The absolute cost per QALY is sometimes less important in decision‐making than how much the cost per QALY differs between an old, inexpensive therapy and a new, expensive one. The new drug may be only marginally more effective but many times the price. The value used to compare whether the benefit is ‘worth it’ is known as the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER). A good example of this is the recent introduction of dabigatran (an expensive anticoagulant but one that is less hassle for the patient than warfarin, as it involves fewer blood tests), whose ICER compared to warfarin has been estimated at £13 957 [17].

Until a few years ago, one of my many ‘committee jobs’ was sitting on the Appraisals Committee of the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which advises the Department of Health on the cost‐effectiveness of medicines. It is very rare for the members of that multidisciplinary committee to get through a discussion on whether to recommend funding a controversial drug without major differences of opinion surfacing and emotions rising – even when (as is invariably the case) a detailed

Assessment of QALYs is presented. The disputes are not about the numbers, but about the assumptions that underpin those numbers. Just about any measure of health state preference values is a reflection of the preferences and prejudices of the individuals who contributed to its development. Indeed, it is possible to come up with different values for QALYs depending on how the questions from which health state preference values are derived were posed [18].

As medical ethicist John Harris has pointed out, QALYs are, like the society which produces them, inherently ageist, sexist, racist and loaded against those with permanent disabilities (because even a complete cure of an unrelated condition would not restore the individual to ‘perfect health’). Furthermore, QALYs distort our ethical instincts by focusing our minds on life‐years rather than people’s lives. A disabled premature infant in need of an intensive care cot will, argues Harris, be allocated more resources than it deserves in comparison with a 50‐year‐old woman with cancer because the infant, were it to survive, would have so many more life years to quality‐adjust [19].

There is an increasingly confusing array of alternatives to the QALY [5,7,20,21]. Some of the ones that were in vogue when this book went to press include:

- Healthy Years Equivalent (HYE), a QALY‐type measure that incorporates the individual’s likely improvement or deterioration in health status in the future;
- Willingness to Pay (WTP) or Willingness to Accept (WTA), measures of how much people would be prepared to pay to gain certain benefits or avoid certain problems;
- Disability‐Adjusted Life Year (DALY), used mainly in the developing world to assess the overall burden of chronic disease and deprivation – an increasingly used measure that is not without its critics; and, perhaps most bizarrely:
- Q‐TWiST (quality‐adjusted time spent without symptoms of disease and toxicity of treatment).

My personal advice on all these measures is to look carefully at what goes into the number that is supposed to be an ‘objective’ indicator of a person’s (or population’s) health status, and at how the different measures might differ according to different disease states. They all have potential uses but none of them is an absolute or incontrovertible measure of health or illness. (Note, also, that I do not claim to be an expert on any of these measures or on how to calculate them – which is why I have offered a generous list of additional references at the end of this chapter.)

However, there is another form of analysis that, although it does not abolish the need to place arbitrary numerical values on life and limb, avoids the buck stopping with the unfortunate health economist. This approach, known as cost–consequences analysis, presents the results of the economic analysis in a disaggregated form. In other words, it expresses different outcomes in terms of their different natural units (i.e. something real such as months of survival, legs amputated or take‐home babies), so that individuals can assign their own values to particular health states before comparing two quite different interventions (e.g. infertility treatment with cholesterol lowering, as in the example I mentioned in Chapter 1). Cost–consequences analysis allows for the health state preference values of both individuals and society to change with time, and is particularly useful when these are disputed or likely to change. This approach also allows the analysis to be used by different groups or societies from the ones on which the original trial was performed.

A note on ‘Choosing Wisely’

As the population ages and more and more of us live many years with expensive‐to‐treat chronic illness, many healthcare systems around the world are struggling to make ends meet. While many of us would be willing to pay more taxes to assure the best healthcare for everyone, there is also the question of how much money we are spending on tests, treatments and follow‐up visits that don’t do the patient any good (and which might even do harm). When a patient consults with a condition for which the standard management is hard‐wired into every doctor’s brain, most of us don’t routinely consider whether that management is either effective or cost‐effective – we just follow the pattern (prescribe, send for tests, refer to specialist and so on).

A relatively new movement called ‘Choosing Wisely’ is campaigning for the use of evidence‐based principles, including sound health economics, to inform local and national policy to reduce the use of ineffective and costly healthcare. You may be familiar with some classic examples of treatments that were once considered good practice but are now viewed as unnecessary in most cases (tonsillectomy in children for example) and a waste of resources. For more on Choosing Wisely, see the papers by Cassel and Guest [22] from the USA and Wise [23] from the UK.

Ten questions to ask about an economic analysis

The elementary checklist that follows is based largely on the sources mentioned in the first paragraph of this chapter. I strongly recommend that for a more definitive list, you check out these sources – especially the official recommendations by the BMJ working group [1].
---
# Chapter 11

How to read a paper

Question One: Is pe analysis based on a study pat answers a clearly defined clinical question about an economically important issue?
Before you attempt to digest what a paper says about costs, quality of life scales or utilities, make sure pat pe trial being analysed is scientifically relevant and capable of giving unbiased and unambiguous answers to pe clinical question posed in its introduction (see Chapter 4). Furpermore, if pere is clearly little to choose between pe interventions in terms of eiper costs or benefits, a detailed economic analysis is probably pointless.

Question Two: Whose viewpoint are costs and benefits being considered from?
From pe patient’s point of view, he or she generally wants to get better as quickly as possible. From pe Treasury’s point of view, pe most cost‐effective healp intervention is one pat returns all citizens promptly to taxpayer status and, when pis status is no longer tenable, causes immediate sudden deap. From pe drug company’s point of view, it would be difficult to imagine a cost–benefit equation pat did not contain one of pe company’s products, and from a physioperapist’s point of view, pe removal of a physioperapy service would never be cost‐effective. There is no such ping as an economic analysis pat is devoid of perspective. Most assume pe perspective of pe healpcare system itself, alpough some take into account pe hidden costs to pe patient and society (e.g. as a result of work days lost). There is no ‘right’ perspective for an economic evaluation – but pe paper should say clearly whose costs and whose benefits have been counted ‘in’ and ‘out’. You might like to look up Carl May’s work on ‘burden of treatment’ – pe additional work and hassle pat patients take on when encouraged to ‘self‐manage’ peir illness [24].

Question Three: Have pe interventions being compared been shown to be clinically effective?
Nobody wants inexpensive treatment if it doesn’t work. The paper you are reading may simply be an economic analysis, in which case it will be based on a previously published clinical trial, or it will be an economic evaluation of a new trial whose clinical results are presented in pe same paper. Eiper way, you must make sure pat pe intervention pat ‘works out cheaper’ is not substantially less effective in clinical terms pan pe one pat stands to be rejected on pe grounds of cost. In short, if pe intervention is not effective, it can’t be cost‐effective. (Note, however, pat in a resource‐limited healpcare system, it is often sensible to use treatments pat are a little less effective when pey are a lot less expensive pan pe best on offer.)

Question Four: Are pe interventions sensible and workable in pe settings where pey are likely to be applied?
---
# Papers that tell you what things cost (economic analyses)

A research trial that compares one obscure and unaffordable intervention with another will have little impact on medical practice. Remember that standard current practice (which may be ‘doing nothing’) should almost certainly be one of the alternatives compared. Too many research trials look at intervention packages that would be impossible to implement in the non-research setting (e.g. they assume that GPs will own a state-of-the-art computer and agree to follow a protocol, that infinite nurse time is available for the taking of blood tests or that patients will make their personal treatment choices solely on the basis of the trial’s primary outcome measure).

# Question Five: Which method of analysis was used, and was this appropriate?

This decision can be summarised as given here.

1. If pe interventions produced identical outcomes ⇒ cost-minimisation analysis.
2. If pe important outcome is unidimensional ⇒ cost-effectiveness analysis.
3. If pe important outcome is multidimensional ⇒ cost-utility analysis.
4. If pe outcomes can be expressed meaningfully in monetary terms (i.e. if it is possible to weigh pe cost-benefit equation for pis condition against pe cost-benefit equation for anoper condition) ⇒ cost-benefit analysis.
5. If a cost-benefit analysis would operwise be appropriate but pe preference values given to different healp states are disputed or likely to change ⇒ cost-consequences analysis.

# Question Six: How were costs and benefits measured?

Look back to earlier in this chapter, where I outlined some of the costs associated with my appendix operation. Now imagine a more complicated example – the rehabilitation of stroke patients into their own homes with attendance at a day centre compared with a standard alternative intervention (rehabilitation in a long-stay hospital). The economic analysis must take into account not just the time of the various professionals involved, the time of the secretaries and administrators who help run the service and the cost of the food and drugs consumed by the stroke patients, but also a fraction of the capital cost of building the day centre and maintaining a transport service to and from it.

There are no hard and fast rules for deciding which costs to include. If calculating ‘cost per case’ from first principles, remember that someone has to pay for heating, lighting, personnel support and even the accountants’ bills of the institution. In general terms, these ‘hidden costs’ are known as overheads, and generally add an additional 30–60% on to the cost of a project. The task of costing things like operations and outpatient visits in the UK is easier than it used to be because these experiences are now bought and
---
# Chapter 11

How to read a paper

Sold at a price that reflects (or should reflect) all overheads involved. Be warned, however, that unit costs of health interventions calculated in one country often bear no relation to those of the same intervention elsewhere, even when these costs are expressed as a proportion of gross national product (GNP).

Benefits such as earlier return to work for a particular individual can, on the face of it, be measured in terms of the cost of employing that person at his or her usual daily rate. This approach has the unfortunate consequence of valuing the health of well-paid people higher than that of badly-paid workers, homemakers or the unemployed, and that of the white majority higher than that of (generally) lower paid minority ethnic groups. In the rare cases when health economists seek to take account of patient-borne costs, it might therefore be preferable to derive the cost of sick days from the average national wage.

In a cost-effectiveness analysis, changes in health status will be expressed in natural units (such as babies taken home or ulcers healed). But just because the units are natural does not automatically make them appropriate. For example, the economic analysis of the treatment of peptic ulcer by two different drugs might measure outcome as 'proportion of ulcers healed after a 6-week course'. Treatments could be compared according to the cost per ulcer healed. However, if the relapse rates on the two drugs were very different, drug A might be falsely deemed 'more cost-effective' than drug B. A better outcome measure here might be 'ulcers which remained healed at one year'.

In cost-benefit analysis, where health status is expressed in utility units, such as QALYs, you would, if you were being really rigorous about evaluating the paper, look back at how the particular utilities used in the analysis were derived. In particular, you will want to know whose health preference values were used – those of patients, doctors, health economists or the government.

Question Seven: Were incremental, rather than absolute, benefits considered? This question is best illustrated by a simple example. Let’s say drug X, at £100 per course, cures 10 out of every 20 patients. Its new competitor, drug Y, costs £120 per course and cures 11 out of 20 patients. The cost per case cured with drug X is £200 (because you spent £2000 curing 10 people), and the cost per case cured with drug Y is £218 (because you spent £2400 curing 11 people).

The incremental cost of drug Y – that is, the extra cost of curing the extra patient – is NOT £18 but £400, as this is the total amount extra that you have had to pay to achieve an outcome over and above what you would have achieved by giving all patients the cheaper drug. This striking example
---
# Papers that tell you what things cost (economic analyses)

should be borne in mind the next time a pharmaceutical representative tries
to persuade you that his or her product is ‘more effective and only marginally
more expensive’.

# Question Eight: Was the ‘here and now’ given precedence over the distant future?

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. In health as well as money terms,
we value a benefit today more highly than we value a promise of the same
benefit in 5 years’ time. When the costs or benefits of an intervention (or lack
of the intervention) will occur sometime in the future, their value should
be discounted to reflect this. The actual amount of discount that should be
allowed for future, as opposed to immediate, health benefit, is pretty arbitrary, but most analyses use a figure of around 5% per year.

# Question Nine: Was a sensitivity analysis performed?

Let’s say a cost–benefit analysis comes out as saying that hernia repair by
day‐case surgery costs £1500 per QALY, whereas traditional open repair,
with its associated hospital stay, costs £2100 per QALY. But, when you look
at how the calculations were performed, you are surprised at how cheaply
the laparoscopic equipment has been costed. If you raise the price of this
equipment by 25%, does day‐case surgery still come out dramatically
cheaper? It may, or it may not.
Sensitivity analysis, or exploration of ‘what‐ifs’, was described in Chapter 8
‘Validating diagnostic tests against a gold standard’ in relation to meta‐analysis.
Exactly the same principles apply here: if adjusting the figures to account for
the full range of possible influences gives you a totally different answer, you should not place too much reliance on the analysis. For a good example of a
sensitivity analysis on a topic of both scientific and political importance, see
the paper by Jha and Modi [12] on the cost‐effectiveness of statin therapy
in people with different levels of baseline risk for cardiovascular disease.

# Question Ten: Were ‘bottom line’ aggregate scores overused?

Earlier in this chapter, I introduced the notion of cost–consequences analysis,
in which the reader of the paper can attach his or her own values to different
utilities. In practice, this is an unusual way of presenting an economic
analysis, and, more commonly, the reader is faced with a cost–utility or cost–
benefit analysis that gives a composite score in unfamiliar units which do not
translate readily into exactly what gains and losses the patient can expect.
The situation is analogous to the father who is told, ‘your child’s intelligence
quotient is 115’, when he would feel far better informed if he were presented
with the disaggregated data: ‘Johnny can read, write, count, and draw pretty
well for his age’.

# Conclusions

I hope this chapter has shown that the critical appraisal of an economic analysis rests as crucially on asking questions such as, ‘where did those numbers come from?’ and ‘have any numbers been left out?’ as on checking that the sums themselves were correct. While few papers will fulfil all the criteria listed in the section ‘Ten questions to ask about an economic analysis’ and summarised in Appendix 1, you should, after reading the chapter, be able to distinguish an economic analysis of moderate or good methodological quality from one that slips ‘throwaway costings’ (‘drug X costs less than drug Y; therefore it is more cost‐effective’) into its results or discussion section.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Drugs ending in ‘ab’ are usually monoclonal antibodies (expensive ‘designer drugs’ aimed at a particular molecule), which sometimes but not always have a major effect on disease progression. The economics of such drugs are often dramatic (they cost a lot, but they may also transform patients’ lives). Take a look at the paper by Bermejo et al. [25], which describes the evaluation of mepolizumab for severe asthma. Was the drug effective? Was it cost‐effective? What assumptions went into the economic model? Why would you not recommend this drug for all cases of asthma?
2. Telehealth (medical devices that link patients remotely to health services) and telecare (alarms and sensors that help older people live safely in their own homes) are sometimes seen as a future service model for older people with multiple health and social care needs. But look at these two cost‐effectiveness studies – one on telehealth and one on telecare, both based on the same large UK trial [26]. How cost‐effective were telehealth and telecare? What assumptions were made in coming to these figures? Given that telehealth and telecare equipment is becoming better and cheaper, can you suggest ways in which these service models might become more cost‐effective in the future?

What is qualitative research?

Thirty years ago, when I took up my first research post, a work-weary colleague advised me: ‘Find something to measure, and keep on measuring it until you’ve got a boxful of data. Then stop measuring and start writing up.’

‘But what should I measure?’ I asked.

‘That’, he said cynically, ‘doesn’t much matter’.

This true example illustrates the limitations of an exclusively quantitative (counting-and-measuring) perspective in research. Epidemiologist Nick Black has argued that a finding or a result is more likely to be accepted as a fact if it is quantified (expressed in numbers) than if it is not [1]. There is little or no scientific evidence, for example, to support the well-known ‘facts’ that one couple in ten is infertile or that one person in ten is homosexual. Yet, observes Black, most of us are happy to accept uncritically such simplified, reductionist and blatantly incorrect statements so long as they contain at least one number.

Qualitative researchers seek a deeper truth. They aim to ‘study things in their natural setting, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them’ [2], and they use ‘a holistic perspective which preserves the complexities of human behaviour’ [2].

Interpretive or qualitative research was for years the territory of the social scientists. It is now increasingly recognised as being not just complementary to but, in many cases, a prerequisite for the quantitative research with which most us who trained in the biomedical sciences are more familiar. Certainly, the view that the two approaches are mutually exclusive has itself become ‘unscientific’, and it is currently rather trendy, particularly in the fields of primary care and health services research, to say that you are doing some qualitative research – and since the first edition of this book was published, qualitative research has even become mainstream within the evidence-based

medicine movement [3,4]. There is now a chapter on qualitative research in the Cochrane Handbook [5] and, as described in Chapter 7, there have been major developments in the science of integrating qualitative and quantitative evidence in the development and evaluation of complex interventions.

The late Cecil Helman, an anthropologist as well as a medical doctor, told me the following story to illustrate the qualitative–quantitative dichotomy. A small child runs in from the garden and says, excitedly, ‘Mummy, the leaves are falling off the trees.’

‘Tell me more’, says his mother.

‘Well, five leaves fell in the first hour, then ten leaves fell in the second hour …’

That child will become a quantitative researcher.

A second child, when asked ‘tell me more’, might reply, ‘Well, the leaves are big and flat, and mostly yellow or red, and they seem to be falling off some trees but not others. And mummy, why did no leaves fall last month?’

That child will become a qualitative researcher.

Questions such as ‘How many parents would consult their general practitioner when their child has a mild temperature?’ or ‘What proportion of smokers have tried to give up?’ clearly need answering through quantitative methods. But questions like ‘Why do parents worry so much about their children’s temperature?’ and ‘What stops people giving up smoking?’ cannot and should not be answered by leaping in and measuring the first aspect of the problem that we (the outsiders) think might be important. Rather, we need to hang out, listen to what people have to say and explore the ideas and concerns that the individuals themselves come up with. After a while, we may notice a pattern emerging, which may prompt us to make our observations in a different way. We may start with one of the methods shown in Table 12.1, and go on to use a selection of others.

Table 12.2
from Nick Mays and Catherine Pope’s classic introductory paper ‘Qualitative Research in Health Care’ [6] summarises (indeed overstates) the differences between the qualitative and quantitative approaches to research. In reality, there is much to be said for integrating both in a mixed‐methods design [7].

Quantitative research generally begins with an idea (usually articulated as a hypothesis), which then, through measurement, generates data and, by deduction, allows a conclusion to be drawn. Qualitative research is different. It begins with an intention to explore a particular area, collects data (e.g. observations, interviews, documents – even emails can count as qualitative data) and generates ideas and hypotheses from these data largely through what is known as inductive reasoning [2]. The strength of quantitative approach lies in its reliability (repeatability) – that is, the same measurements should yield the same results time after time. The strength of qualitative

Research lies in validity (closeness to the truth) - that is, good qualitative research, using a selection of data collection methods, really should touch the core of what is going on rather than just skimming the surface. The validity of qualitative methods is said to be greatly improved by the use of more than one method (Table 12.1) in combination (a process sometimes known as triangulation), by the researcher thinking carefully about what is going on and how their own perspective might be influencing the data (an approach known as reflexivity) [8], and - some would argue - by more than one researcher analyzing the same data independently (to demonstrate inter-rater reliability).

Since I wrote the first edition of this book, inter-rater reliability has become less credible as a measure of quality in qualitative research. Appraisers of

How to read a paper

Qualitative papers increasingly seek to assess the competence and reflexivity of a single researcher rather than confirm that the findings were ‘checked by someone else’. This change is attributable to two important insights. First, in most qualitative research, one person knows the data far better than anyone else, so the idea that two heads are better than one simply isn’t true – a researcher who has been brought in merely to verify ‘themes’ may rely far more on personal preconceptions and guesswork than the main field worker. Second, with the trend towards more people from biomedical backgrounds doing qualitative research, it’s not at all uncommon for two (or even a whole team of) naïve and untrained researchers setting up focus groups or running fast and loose with the free‐text responses of questionnaires. Not only does ‘agreement’ between these individuals not correspond to quality, but teams from similar backgrounds are also likely to bring similar biases, so high inter‐rater reliability scores can be entirely spurious.

Those who are ignorant about qualitative research often believe that it constitutes little more than hanging out and watching leaves fall. It is beyond the scope of this book to take you through the substantial literature on how to (and how not to) proceed when observing, interviewing, leading a focus group and so on. But sophisticated methods for all these techniques certainly exist, and if you are interested I suggest you try the excellent BMJ series by Scott Reeves and colleagues from Canada [9–13].

Qualitative methods really come into their own when researching uncharted territory – that is, where the variables of greatest concern are poorly understood, ill‐defined and cannot be controlled. In such circumstances, the definitive hypothesis may not be arrived at until the study is well under way. But it is in precisely these circumstances that the qualitative researcher must ensure that he or she has, at the outset, carefully delineated a particular focus of research and identified some specific questions to try to answer (see Question One in section ‘Ten questions to ask about a qualitative research paper’). The methods of qualitative research allow for – indeed, they require – modification of the research question in the light of findings generated along the way – a technique known as progressive focusing [6]. (In contrast, sneaking a look at the interim results of a quantitative study is poor science for reasons a statistician will explain to you.)

The so‐called iterative approach (altering the research methods and the hypothesis as you go along) employed by qualitative researchers shows a commendable sensitivity to the richness and variability of the topic. Failure to recognise the legitimacy of this approach has, in the past, led critics to accuse qualitative researchers of continually moving their own goalposts. While these criticisms are often misguided, there is a danger that when qualitative research is undertaken unrigorously by naïve researchers, the

# Papers that go beyond numbers (qualitative research)

By its very nature, qualitative research is non-standard, unconfined and dependent on the subjective experience of both the researcher and the researched. It explores what needs to be explored and cuts its cloth accordingly. As implied in the previous section, qualitative research is an in-depth interpretive task, not a technical procedure. It depends crucially on a competent and experienced researcher exercising the kind of skills and judgments that are difficult, if not impossible, to measure objectively. It is debatable, therefore, whether an all-encompassing critical appraisal checklist along the lines of the Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature for quantitative research could ever be developed, although valiant attempts have been made. Some people have argued that critical appraisal checklists potentially detract from research quality in qualitative research because they encourage a mechanistic and protocol-driven approach.

My own view, and that of a number of individuals who have attempted, or are currently working on, this very task, is that such a checklist may not be as exhaustive or as universally applicable as the various guides for appraising quantitative research, but that it is certainly possible to set some ground rules. In my view, the best attempt to offer guidance (and also the best exposition of the uncertainties and unknowables) has been made by Dixon-Woods and colleagues. The list that follows has been distilled from the published work cited elsewhere in this chapter, and also from discussions many years ago with Rod Taylor, who produced one of the earliest critical appraisal guides for qualitative papers.

# Ten questions to ask about a qualitative research paper

Question One: Did the paper describe an important problem addressed via a clearly formulated question?

In Chapter 3 ‘Three preliminary questions to get your bearings’, I explained that one of the first things you should look for in any research paper is a statement of why the research was carried out and what specific question it addressed. Qualitative papers are no exception to this rule: there is absolutely no scientific value in interviewing or observing people just for the sake of it. Papers that cannot define their topic of research more closely than ‘we decided to interview 20 patients with epilepsy’ inspire little confidence that the researchers really knew what they were studying or why. You might be more inclined to read on if the paper stated in its introduction something

Like, ‘Epilepsy is a common and potentially disabling condition, and a significant proportion of patients do not remain fit‐free on medication. Antiepileptic medication is known to have unpleasant side effects, and several studies have shown that a high proportion of patients do not take their tablets regularly. We therefore decided to explore patients’ beliefs about epilepsy and their perceived reasons for not taking their medication.’ As I explained earlier in this chapter, the iterative nature of qualitative research is such that the definitive research question may not be clearly focused at the outset of the study, but it should certainly have been formulated by the time the report is written.

Question Two: Was a qualitative approach appropriate?

If the objective of the research was to explore, interpret or obtain a deeper understanding of a particular clinical issue, qualitative methods were almost certainly the most appropriate ones to use. However, if the research aimed to achieve some other goal (such as determining the incidence of a disease or the frequency of an adverse drug reaction, testing a cause‐and‐effect hypothesis, or showing that one drug has a better risk–benefit ratio than another), qualitative methods are clearly inappropriate. An interesting grey zone is measuring attitudes. Qualitative research can certainly pick up people’s attitudes (say, patients’ attitudes towards their local health service) but if you want to be able to say something like “90% of people are satisfied with our service”, you need a quantitative study design such as a closed‐item survey (see Chapter 13).

Question Three: How were (i) the setting and (ii) the participants selected?

Look back at Table 12.2, which contrasts the statistical sampling methods of quantitative research with theoretical ones of qualitative research. Let me explain what this means. In the earlier chapters, particularly Chapter 4 ‘Whom is the study about?’ I emphasised the importance, in quantitative research, of ensuring that a truly random sample of participants is recruited. A random sample will ensure that the results reflect, on average, the condition of the population from which that sample was drawn.

In qualitative research, however, we are not interested in an ‘on‐average’ view of a patient population. We want to gain an in‐depth understanding of the experience of particular individuals or groups, and we should, therefore, deliberately seek out individuals or groups who fit the bill. If, for example, we wished to study the experience of women when they gave birth in hospital, we would be perfectly justified in going out of our way to find women who had had a range of different birth experiences – an induced delivery, an emergency caesarean section, a delivery by a medical student, a late miscarriage and so on.
---
# Papers that go beyond numbers (qualitative research)

We would also wish to select some women who had had shared antenatal
care between an obstetrician and their general practitioner, and some
women who had been cared for by community midwives throughout the
pregnancy. In this example, it might be particularly instructive to find
women who had had their care provided by male doctors, even though this
would be a relatively unusual situation. Finally, we might choose to study
patients who gave birth in the setting of a large, modern, ‘high‐tech’ maternity unit as well as some who did so in a small community hospital. Of course, all these specifications will give us ‘biased’ samples, but that is exactly what we want.

Watch out for qualitative research where the sample has been selected (or
appears to have been selected) purely on the basis of convenience. In the
above‐mentioned example, taking the first dozen patients to pass through
the nearest labour ward would be the easiest way to notch up interviews, but
the information obtained may be considerably less helpful.

# Question Four: What was the researcher’s perspective, and has this been taken into account?

Given that qualitative research is necessarily grounded in real‐life experience, a paper describing such research should not be ‘trashed’ simply because the researchers have declared a particular cultural perspective or personal involvement with the participants of the research. Quite the reverse: they should be congratulated for doing just that. It is important to recognise that there is no way of abolishing, or fully controlling for, observer bias in qualitative research. This is most obviously the case when participant observation (Table 12.1) is used, but it is also true for other forms of data collection and of data analysis.

If, for example, the research concerns the experience of adults with asthma living in damp and overcrowded housing and the perceived effect of these surroundings on their health, the data generated by techniques such as focus groups or semi‐structured interviews are likely to be heavily influenced by what the interviewer believes about this subject and by whether he or she is employed by the hospital chest clinic, the social work department of the local authority or an environmental pressure group. But because it is inconceivable that the interviews could have been conducted by someone with no views at all and no ideological or cultural perspective, the most that can be required of the researchers is that they describe in detail where they are coming from so that the results can be interpreted accordingly.

It is for this reason, incidentally, that qualitative researchers generally prefer to write up their work in the first person (‘I interviewed the participants’ rather than ‘the participants were interviewed’), because this makes explicit the role and influence of the researcher.

Question Five: What mepods did pe researcher use for collecting data, and are pese described in enough detail?
I once spent 2 years doing highly quantitative, laboratory-based experimental research in which around 15 h of every week were spent filling or emptying test tubes. There was a standard way to fill pe test tubes, a standard way to spin pem in pe centrifuge and even a standard way to wash pem up. When I finally published my research, some 900 h of drudgery was summed up in a single sentence: ‘Patients’ serum rhubarb levels were measured according to pe mepod described by Bloggs and Bloggs [reference to Bloggs and Bloggs’ paper on how to measure serum rhubarb]’.
I now spend quite a lot of my time doing qualitative research, and I can confirm pat it’s infinitely more fun. My research colleagues and I have spent some 20 years exploring pe beliefs, hopes, fears and attitudes of diabetic patients from pe minority epnic groups in pe East End of London (we began wip British Bangladeshis and extended pe work to oper Soup Asian and – later – oper epnic groups). We had to develop, for example, a valid way of simultaneously translating and transcribing interviews pat were conducted in Sylheti, a complex dialect of Bengali which has no written form. We found pat participants’ attitudes appear to be heavily influenced by pe presence in pe room of certain of peir relatives, so we contrived to interview some patients in bop pe presence and pe absence of pese key relatives.
I could go on describing pe mepods we devised to address pis particular research topic, but I have probably made my point: pe mepods section of a qualitative paper often cannot be written in shorpand or dismissed by reference to someone else’s research techniques. It may have to be lengpy and discursive because it is telling a unique story wipout which pe results cannot be interpreted. As wip pe sampling strategy, pere are no hard and fast rules about exactly what details should be included in pis section of pe paper. You should simply ask, ‘have I been given enough information about pe mepods used?’ and, if you have, use your common sense to assess, ‘are pese mepods a sensible and adequate way of addressing pe research question?’

Question Six: What mepods did pe researcher use to analyse pe data?
The data analysis section of a qualitative research paper is pe opportunity for pe researcher(s) to demonstrate pe difference between sense and nonsense. Having amassed a pick pile of completed interview transcripts or field notes, pe genuine qualitative researcher has hardly begun. It is simply not good enough to flick prough pe text looking for ‘interesting quotes’ to support a particular peory. The researcher must find a systematic way of analysing his or her data, and, in particular, must seek to detect and interpret items of data pat appear to contradict or challenge pe peories derived from pe majority.
---
# Papers that go beyond numbers (qualitative research)

One of the best short articles on qualitative data analysis was published by Cathy Pope and colleagues in the British Medical Journal a few years ago – look it out if you’re new to this field and want to know where to start [17]. If you want the definitive textbook on qualitative research, which describes multiple different approaches to analysis, try the marvellous tome edited by Denzin and Lincoln [2].

By far the most common way of analysing the kind of qualitative data that is generally collected in biomedical research is thematic analysis. In this, the researchers go through printouts of free text, draw up a list of broad themes and allocate coding categories to each. For example, a ‘theme’ might be patients’ knowledge about their illness and within this theme, codes might include ‘transmissible causes’, ‘supernatural causes’, ‘causes due to own behaviour’ and so on. Note that these codes do not correspond to a conventional biomedical taxonomy (‘genetic’, ‘infectious’, ‘metabolic’ and so on), because the point of the research is to explore the interviewees’ taxonomy, whether the researcher agrees with it or not. Thematic analysis is often tackled by drawing up a matrix or framework with a new column for each theme and a new row for each ‘case’ (e.g. an interview transcript), and cutting and pasting relevant segments of text into each box [14]. Another type of thematic analysis is the constant comparative method – in which each new piece of data is compared with the emerging summary of all the previous items, allowing step-by-step refinement of an emerging theory [18].

Quite commonly these days, qualitative data analysis is performed with the help of a computer programme such as ATLAS-TI or NVIVO, which makes it much easier to handle large datasets. The statements made by all the interviewees on a particular topic can be compared with one another, and sophisticated comparisons can be made such as ‘did people who made statement A also tend to make statement B?’ But remember, a qualitative computer programme does not analyse the data by autopilot, any more than a quantitative programme like SPSS can tell the researcher which statistical test to apply in each case! While the sentence ‘data were analysed using NVIVO’ might appear impressive, the GIGO rule (garbage in, garbage out) often applies. Excellent qualitative data analysis can occur using the VLDRT (very large dining room table) method, in which printouts of (say) interviews are marked up with felt pens and (say) the constant comparative method is undertaken manually instead of electronically.

# Question Seven: What quality control measures were implemented?

It’s often difficult when writing up qualitative research to demonstrate how quality control was achieved. As mentioned in the previous section, just because the data have been analysed by more than one researcher does not necessarily assure rigour. Indeed, researchers who never disagree on their
---
# Chapter 12

How to read a paper

Subjective judgements (is a particular paragraph in a patient’s account really evidence of ‘anxiety’ or ‘disempowerment’ or ‘trust’?) are probably not thinking hard enough about their own interpretations. The essence of quality in such circumstances is more to do with the level of critical dialogue between the researchers, and in how disagreements were exposed and resolved. In analysing my early research data on the health beliefs of British Bangladeshis with diabetes, for example, three of us looked in turn at a typed interview transcript and assigned codings to particular statements [19]. We then compared our decisions and argued (sometimes heatedly) about our disagreements. Our analysis revealed differences in the interpretation of certain statements that we were unable to fully resolve. For example, we never reached agreement about what the term exercise means in this ethnic group. This did not mean that one of us was ‘wrong’ but that there were inherent ambiguities in the data. Perhaps, for example, this sample of interviewees were themselves confused about what the term exercise means and the benefits it offers to people with diabetes.

Question Eight: Are the results credible, and if so, are they clinically important?

We obviously cannot assess the credibility of qualitative results via the precision and accuracy of measuring devices, nor their significance via confidence intervals and numbers needed to treat. The most important tool to determine whether the results are sensible and believable, and whether they matter in practice, is plain common sense.

An important aspect of the results section to check is whether the authors cite actual data. Claims such as ‘general practitioners did not usually recognise the value of annual appraisal’ would be more credible if one or two verbatim quotes from the interviewees were reproduced to illustrate them. The results should be independently and objectively verifiable (e.g. by including longer segments of text in an appendix or online resource), and all quotes and examples should be indexed so that they can be traced back to an identifiable interviewee and data source.

Question Nine: What conclusions were drawn, and are they justified by the results?

A quantitative research paper, presented in standard Introduction, Methods, Research and Discussion (IMRAD) format (see Chapter 3), should clearly distinguish the study’s results (usually a set of numbers) from the interpretation of those results. The reader should have no difficulty separating what the researchers found from what they think it means. In qualitative research, however, such a distinction is rarely possible, as the results are by definition an interpretation of the data. It is therefore necessary, when assessing the
---
# Papers that go beyond numbers (qualitative research)

Validity of qualitative research, to ask whether the interpretation placed on
the data accords with common sense and that the researcher’s personal, professional and cultural perspective is made explicit so the reader can assess the ‘lens’ through which the researcher has undertaken the fieldwork, analysis and interpretation. This can be a difficult exercise because the language we use to describe things tends to impugn meanings and motives that the participants themselves may not share. Compare, for example, the two statements, ‘three women went to the well to get water’ and ‘three women met at the well and each was carrying a pitcher’.

It is becoming a cliché that the conclusions of qualitative studies, like those of all research, should be ‘grounded in evidence’ – that is, that they should flow from what the researchers found in the field. Mays and Pope [6] suggest three useful questions for determining whether the conclusions of a qualitative study are valid.

1. How well does this analysis explain why people behave in the way they do?
2. How comprehensible would this explanation be to a thoughtful participant in the setting?
3. How well does the explanation cohere with what we already know?

Question Ten: Are the findings of the study transferable to other settings?
One of the most common criticisms of qualitative research is that the findings of any qualitative study pertain only to the limited setting in which they were obtained. In fact, this is not necessarily any truer of qualitative research than of quantitative research. Look back at the example of women’s birth experiences that I described in Question Three. A convenience sample of the first dozen women to give birth would provide little more than the collected experiences of these 12 women. A purposive sample as described in Question Three would extend the transferability of the findings to women having a wide range of birth experience. But by making iterative adjustments to the sampling frame as the research study unfolds, the researchers will be able to develop a theoretical sample and test new theories as they emerge. For example (and note, I’m making this example up), the researchers might find that better educated women seem to have more psychologically traumatic experiences than less well‐educated women. This might lead to a new hypothesis about women’s expectations (the better educated the woman, the more she expects a ‘perfect birth experience’), which would in turn lead to a change in the purposive sampling strategy (we now want to find extremes of maternal education), and so on. The more the research has been driven by this kind of progressive focusing and iterative data analysis, the more its findings are likely to be transferable beyond the sample itself.

# Conclusions

Doctors have traditionally placed high value on number-based data, which may in reality be misleading, reductionist and irrelevant to the real issues. The increasing popularity of qualitative research in the biomedical sciences has arisen largely because quantitative methods provided either no answers, or the wrong answers, to important questions in both clinical care and service delivery. If you still feel that qualitative research is necessarily second rate by virtue of being a ‘soft’ science, you should be aware that you are out of step with the evidence.

Back in 1993, Catherine Pope and Nicky Britten presented at a conference a paper entitled ‘Barriers to qualitative methods in the medical mindset’, in which they showed their collection of rejection letters from biomedical journals [20]. The letters revealed a striking ignorance of qualitative methodology on the part of reviewers. In other words, the people who had rejected the papers often appeared to be incapable of distinguishing good qualitative research from bad.

Somewhat ironically, poor-quality qualitative papers now appear regularly in some medical journals, which appear to have undergone an about-face in editorial policy since Pope and Britten’s exposure of the ‘medical mindset’. I hope, therefore, that the questions listed earlier, and the subsequent references, will assist reviewers in both camps: those who continue to reject qualitative papers for the wrong reasons and those who have climbed on the qualitative bandwagon and are now accepting such papers for the wrong reasons! If you’re interested in qualitative research, you might like to read the open letter my colleagues and I wrote to the British Medical Journal asking them to change their editorial bias against qualitative research [21].

The rise and rise of questionnaire research

When and where did you last fill out a questionnaire? They come through the door, and appear in our pigeon holes at work. We get them as email attachments and find them in the dentist’s waiting room. The kids bring them home from school, and it’s not uncommon for one to accompany the bill in a restaurant. I recently met someone at a party who described himself as a ‘questionnaire mugger’ – his job was to stop people in the street and take down their answers to a list of questions about their income, tastes, shopping preferences and goodness knows what else.

This chapter is based on a series of papers I edited for the British Medical Journal, written by a team led by my colleague Petra Boynton [1–3]. She has taught me a great deal about this widely used research technique, including the fact that there’s probably more bad questionnaire research in the literature than just about any other study design. While you need a laboratory to do bad lab work, and a supply of medicines to do bad pharmaceutical research, all you need to do to produce bad questionnaire research is write out a list of questions, photocopy it and ask a few people to fill it in.

Questionnaires are often considered as an ‘objective’ means of collecting information about people’s knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and behaviour [4,5]. Do our patients like our opening hours? What do teenagers think of a local anti‐drugs campaign – and has it changed their attitudes? How much do nurses know about the management of asthma? What proportion of the population view themselves as gay or bisexual? Why don’t doctors use computers to their maximum potential? You can probably see from these examples that questionnaires can seek both quantitative data (x percent of people like our services) and qualitative data (people using our services have xyz experiences). In other words, questionnaires are not a ‘quantitative method’ or a ‘qualitative method’ but a tool for collecting a range of different types of data.

How to read a paper

Depending on the question asked in each item and the format in which responders are expected to answer them. I’ve already used the expression GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) in previous chapters to make the point that poorly structured instruments lead to poor quality data, misleading conclusions and woolly recommendations. Nowhere is that more true than in questionnaire research. While clear guidance on the design and reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews is now widely used (see the discussion about the CONSORT checklist in Chapter 6 and the QUORUM and PRISMA checklists in Chapter 9), comparable frameworks for questionnaire research have been published in relatively obscure journals and are less widely cited [4–8]. Perhaps for this reason, despite a wealth of detailed guidance in the specialist literature [9,10], elementary methodological errors are common in questionnaire research undertaken by health professionals [1–3]. Before we turn to the critical appraisal, a word about terminology. A questionnaire is designed to measure formally an aspect of human psychology. We sometimes refer to questionnaires as ‘instruments’. The questions within a questionnaire are sometimes known as items. An item is the smallest unit within the questionnaire that is individually scored. It might comprise a stem (‘pick which of the following responses corresponds to your own view’) and then five possible options. Or it might be a simple ‘yes/no’ or ‘true/false’ response.

Ten questions to ask about a paper describing a questionnaire study

Question One: What was the research question, and was the questionnaire appropriate for answering it? Look back to Chapter 3, where I describe three preliminary questions to get you started in appraising any paper. The first of these was ‘what was the research question – and why was the study needed?’ This is a particularly good starter question for questionnaire studies, because inexperienced researchers often embark on questionnaire research without clarifying why they are doing it or what they want to find out. In addition, people often decide to use a questionnaire for studies that need a totally different method. Sometimes, a questionnaire will be appropriate but only if used within a mixed method study (e.g. to extend and quantify the findings of an initial exploratory phase). Table 13.1 gives some real examples based on papers that Petra Boynton and I collected from the published literature and offered by participants in courses we have run. There are many advantages to researchers of using a previously validated and published questionnaire. The research team will save time and resources;

|Broad area of research|Example of research questions|Why is a questionnaire not the most appropriate method?|What method(s) should be used instead?|
|---|---|---|---|
|Burden of disease|What is the prevalence of asthma in schoolchildren?|A child may have asthma but the parent does not know it; parents may think incorrectly that their child has asthma; or they may withhold information that is perceived as stigmatising|Cross‐sectional survey using standardised diagnostic criteria and/or systematic analysis of medical records|
|Professional behaviour|How do general practitioners manage low back pain?|What doctors say they do is not the same as what they actually do, especially when they think their practice is being judged by others|Direct observation or video recording of consultations; use of simulated patients; systematic analysis of medical records|
|Health‐related lifestyle|What proportion of people in smoking cessation studies quit successfully?|The proportion of true quitters is less than the proportion who say they have quit. A similar pattern is seen in studies of dietary choices, exercise and other lifestyle factors|‘Gold standard’ diagnostic test (in this example, urinary or salivary cotinine)|
|Needs assessment in ‘special needs’ groups|What are the unmet needs of refugees and asylum seekers for health and social care services?|A questionnaire is likely to reflect the preconceptions of researchers (e.g. it may take existing services and/or the needs of more ‘visible’ groups as its starting point) and fail to tap into important areas of need|Range of exploratory qualitative methods designed to build up a ‘rich picture’ of the problem – for example, semi‐structured interviews of users, health professionals and the voluntary sector; focus groups; and in‐depth studies of critical events|

They will be able to compare their own findings with those from other studies; they need only give outline details of the instrument when they write up their work; and they will not need to have gone through a thorough validation process for the instrument. Sadly, inexperienced researchers (most typically, students doing a dissertation) tend to forget to look thoroughly in the literature for a suitable ‘off the peg’ instrument, and such individuals often do not know about formal validation techniques. Even though most such studies will be rejected by journal editors, a worrying proportion find their way into the literature.

Increasingly, health services research uses standard ‘off the peg’ questionnaires designed explicitly for producing data that can be compared across studies. For example, clinical trials routinely include standard instruments to measure patients’ knowledge about a disease [11]; satisfaction with services [12]; or health-related quality of life (QoL) [13,14]. The validity of this approach depends crucially on whether the type and range of closed responses (i.e. the list of possible answers that people are asked to select from) reflects the full range of perceptions and feelings that people in all the different potential sampling frames might actually hold.

Question Two: Was the questionnaire used in the study valid and reliable? A valid questionnaire measures what it claims to measure. In reality, many fail to do this. For example, a self-completion questionnaire that seeks to measure people’s food intake may be invalid, because in reality it measures what they say they have eaten, not what they have actually eaten [15]. Similarly, questionnaires asking general practitioners (GPs) how they manage particular clinical conditions have been shown to differ significantly from actual clinical practice [16]. Note that an instrument developed in a different time, country or cultural context may not be a valid measure in the group you are studying. Here’s a quirky example. The item ‘I often attend gay parties’ was a valid measure of a person’s sociability level in the UK in the 1950s, but the wording has a very different connotation today [1]!

Reliable questionnaires yield consistent results from repeated samples and different researchers over time [9,10]. Differences in the results obtained from a reliable questionnaire come from differences between participants, and not from inconsistencies in how the items are understood or how different observers interpret the responses. A standardised questionnaire is one that is written and administered in a strictly set manner, so all participants are asked precisely the same questions in an identical format and responses recorded in a uniform manner. Standardising a measure increases its reliability. If you participated in the UK Census (General Household Survey) in 2011, you may remember being asked a rather mechanical set of questions. This is because the interviewer had been trained to administer the instrument.

# Papers that report questionnaire research

in a highly standardised way, so as to increase reliability. It’s often difficult to ascertain from a published paper how hard the researchers tried to achieve standardisation, but they may have quoted inter‐rater reliability figures.

# Question Three: What did the questionnaire look like, and was this appropriate for the target population?

When I say ‘what did it look like?’ I am talking about two things – form and content. Form concerns issues such as how many pages was it, was it visually appealing (or off‐putting), how long did it take to fill in, the terminology used and so on. These are not minor issues! A questionnaire that goes on for 30 pages, includes reams of scientific jargon, and contains questions that a respondent might find offensive, will not be properly filled in – and hence the results of a survey will be meaningless [2].

Content is about the actual items. Did the questions make sense, and could the participants in the sample understand them? Were any questions ambiguous or overly complicated? Were ambiguous weasel words such as ‘frequently’, ‘regularly’, ‘commonly’, ‘usually’, ‘many’, ‘some’ and ‘hardly ever’ avoided? Were the items ‘open’ (respondents can write anything they like) or ‘closed’ (respondents must pick from a list of options) – and if the latter, were all potential responses represented? Closed‐ended designs enable researchers to produce aggregated data quickly, but the range of possible answers is set by the researchers, not the respondents, and the richness of responses is therefore much lower [17]. Some respondents (known as yea‐sayers) tend to agree with statements rather than disagree. For this reason, researchers should not present their items so that ‘strongly agree’ always links to the same broad attitude. For example, on a patient satisfaction scale, if one question is ‘my GP generally tries to help me out’, another question should be phrased in the negative – for example, ‘the receptionists are usually impolite’.

# Question Four: Were the instructions clear?

If you have ever been asked to fill out a questionnaire and ‘got lost’ halfway through (or discovered you don’t know where to send it once you’ve filled it Chapter 13 in), you will know that instructions contribute crucially to the validity of the instrument.

- An explanation of what the study is about and what the overall purpose of the research is.
- An assurance of anonymity and confidentiality, as well as confirmation that the person can stop completing the questionnaire at any time without having to give a reason.
- Clear and accurate contact details of whom to approach for further information.
---
# Chapter 13

How to read a paper

- Instructions on what they need to send back and a stamped addressed envelope if it is a postal questionnaire.
- Adequate instructions on how to complete each item, with examples where necessary.
- Any insert (e.g. leaflet), gift (e.g. book token) or honorarium, if these are part of the protocol.

These aspects of the study are unlikely to be listed in the published paper, but they may be in an appendix, and, if not, you should be able to get the information from the authors.

Question Five: Was the questionnaire adequately piloted?

Questionnaires often fail because participants don’t understand them, can’t complete them, get bored or offended by them or dislike how they look [1–3]. Although friends and colleagues can help check spelling, grammar and layout, they cannot reliably predict the emotional reactions or comprehension difficulties of other groups. For this reason, all questionnaires (whether newly developed or ‘off the peg’) should be piloted on participants who are representative of the definitive study sample to see, for example, how long people take to complete the instrument, whether any items are misunderstood, or whether people get bored or confused halfway through. Three specific questions to ask are: (i) what were the characteristics of the participants on whom the instrument was piloted; (ii) how was the piloting exercise undertaken – what details are given and (iii) in what ways was the definitive instrument changed as a result of piloting?

Question Six: What was the sample?

If you have read the previous chapters, you will know that a skewed or non-representative sample will lead to misleading results and unsafe conclusions. When you appraise a questionnaire study, it’s important to ask what the sampling frame was for the definitive study (purposive, random and snowball) and also whether it was sufficiently large and representative. Here are the main types of sample for a questionnaire study (Table 13.2).

|Random sample|A target group is identified, and a random selection of people from that group is invited to participate. For example, a computer might be used to select a random one in four sample from a diabetes register.|
|---|---|
|Stratified random sample|As random sample but the target group is first stratified according to a particular characteristic(s) – for example, diabetic people on insulin, tablets and diet. Random sampling is carried out separately for these different subgroups.|
---
# Papers that report questionnaire research

|Sample type|How it works|When to use|
|---|---|---|
|Opportunity/ convenience|Participants are selected from a group who are available at the time of the study (e.g. patients attending a GP surgery on a particular morning)|Should be avoided if possible|
|Random|A target group is identified, and a random selection of people from that group is invited to participate. For example, a computer might be used to select a random one in four sample from a diabetes register|Use in studies where you wish to reflect the average viewpoint of a population|
|Stratified random|As random sample but the target group is first stratified according to a particular characteristic(s) – for example, diabetic people on insulin, tablets, and diet. Random sampling is carried out separately for these different subgroups|Use when the target group is likely to have systematic differences by subgroup|
|Quota|Participants who match the wider population are identified (e.g. into groups such as social class, gender, age, etc.). Researchers are given a set number within each group to interview (e.g. so many young middle-class women)|For studies where you want to reflect outcomes as closely representative of the wider population as possible. Frequently used in political opinion polls, and so on|
|Snowball|Participants are recruited and asked to identify other similar people to take part in the research. Helpful when working with hard-to-reach groups (e.g. lesbian mothers)| |

Snowball sample: A small group of participants is identified and then asked to ‘invite a friend’ to complete the questionnaire. This group is in turn invited to nominate someone else, and so on.

Opportunity sample: Usually for pragmatic reasons, the first people to appear who meet the criteria are asked to complete the questionnaire. This might happen, for example, in a busy GP surgery when all patients attending on a particular day are asked to fill out a survey about the convenience of opening hours. But such a sample is clearly biased, as those who find the opening hours inconvenient won’t be there in the first place! This example should remind you that opportunity (sometimes known as convenience) samples are rarely if ever scientifically justified.

# Chapter 13

How to read a paper

- Systematically skewed sample: Let’s say you want to assess how satisfied patients are with their GP, and you already know from your pilot study that 80% of people from affluent postcodes will complete the questionnaire but only 60% of those from deprived postcodes will. You could oversample from the latter group to ensure that your dataset reflects the socio-economic make-up of your practice population. (Ideally, if you did this, you would also have to show that people who refused to fill out the questionnaire did not differ in key characteristics from those who completed it.)

It is also important to consider whether the instrument was suitable for all participants and potential participants. In particular, did it take account of the likely range in the sample of physical and intellectual abilities, language and literacy, understanding of numbers or scaling and perceived threat of questions or questioner?

Question Seven: How was the questionnaire administered, and was the response rate adequate?

The methods section of a paper describing a questionnaire study should include details of three aspects of administration: (i) how was the questionnaire distributed (e.g. by post, face-to-face or electronically)? (ii) how was the questionnaire completed (e.g. self-completion or researcher-assisted)? and (iii) were the response rates reported fully, including details of participants who were unsuitable for the research or refused to take part? Have any potential response biases been discussed?

The British Medical Journal will not usually publish a paper describing a questionnaire survey if fewer than 70% of people approached completed the questionnaire properly. There have been a number of research studies on how to increase the response rate to a questionnaire study. In summary, the following have all been shown to increase response rates [3,18].

- The questionnaire is clearly designed and has a simple layout.
- It offers participants incentives or prizes in return for completion.
- It has been thoroughly piloted and tested.
- Participants are notified about the study in advance, with a personalized invitation.
- The aim of the study and means of completing the questionnaire are clearly explained.
- A researcher is on hand to answer questions, and collect the completed questionnaire.
- If using a postal questionnaire, a stamped addressed envelope is included.
- The participants feel they are stakeholders in the study.
---
# Papers that report questionnaire research

Questions are phrased in a way that holds the participants’ attention.

The questionnaire has clear focus and purpose, and is kept concise.

The questionnaire is appealing to look at.

Potential respondents are recruited via peers who have already done the questionnaire.

Another thing to look for in relation to response rates is a table in the paper comparing the characteristics of people who responded with people who were approached but refused to fill out the questionnaire. If there were systematic (as opposed to chance) differences between these groups, the results of the survey will not be generalisable to the population from which the responders were drawn. Responders to surveys conducted in the street, for example, are often older than average (perhaps because they are in less of a hurry!), and less likely to be from an ethnic minority (perhaps because some of the latter are unable to speak the language of the researcher fluently). On the other hand, if the authors of the study have shown that non‐responders are pretty similar to responders, you should worry less about generalisablity even if response rates were lower than you’d have liked.

# Question Eight: How were the data analysed?

Analysis of questionnaire data is a sophisticated science. See these excellent textbooks on social research methods if you’re interested in learning the formal techniques [9,10]. If you are just interested in completing a checklist about a published questionnaire study, try considering these aspects of the study. First, broadly what sort of analysis was carried out and was this appropriate? In particular, were the correct statistical tests used for quantitative responses, and/or was a recognizable method of qualitative analysis (see Chapter 11 ‘Measuring the costs and benefits of health interventions’) used for open‐ended questions? It is reassuring (but by no means a flawless test) to learn that one of the paper’s authors is a statistician. And as I said in Chapter 5, if the statistical tests used are ones you have never heard of, you should probably smell a rat. The vast majority of questionnaire data can be analyzed using commonly used statistical tests such as Chi‐squared, Spearman’s, Pearson correlation, and so on. The most common mistake of all in questionnaire research is to use no statistical tests at all, and you don’t need a PhD in statistics to spot that dodge!

You should also check to ensure that there is no evidence of ‘data dredging’. In other words, have the authors simply thrown their data into a computer and run hundreds of tests, and then dreamt up a plausible hypothesis to go with something that comes out as ‘significant’? In the jargon, all analyses should be hypothesis driven – that is, the hypothesis should be thought up first and then the analysis should be performed, not vice versa.
---
# Chapter 13

How to read a paper

# Question Nine: What were the main results?

Consider first what the overall findings were, and whether all relevant data were reported. Are quantitative results definitive (statistically significant) and are relevant non-significant results also reported? It can be just as important to have discovered, for example, that GPs’ self-reported confidence in managing diabetes is not correlated to their knowledge about the condition as it would have been to discover that there was a correlation. For this reason, the questionnaire study that only comments on the ‘positive’ statistical associations is internally biased.

Another important question is have qualitative results been adequately interpreted (e.g. using an explicit theoretical framework), and have any quotes been properly justified and contextualised (rather than ‘cherry picked’ to spice up the paper)? Look back at Chapter 6 and remind yourself of the tricks used by unscrupulous marketing people to oversell findings. Check carefully the graphs (especially the zero-intercept on axes) and the data tables.

# Question Ten: What are the key conclusions?

This is a common-sense question. What do the results actually mean, and have the researchers drawn an appropriate link between the data and their conclusions? Have the findings been placed within the wider body of knowledge in the field (especially any similar or contrasting surveys using the same instrument)? Have the authors acknowledged the limitations of their study and couched their discussion in the light of these (e.g. if the sample was small or the response rate low, did they recommend further studies to confirm the preliminary findings)? Finally, are any recommendations fully justified by the findings? For example, if they have performed a small, parochial study they should not be suggesting changes in national policy as a result. If you are new to critical appraisal you may find such judgments difficult to make, and the best way to get better is to join in journal club discussions (either face-to-face or online) where a group of you share your common-sense reactions to a chosen paper.

# Conclusions

Anyone can write down a list of questions and photocopy it – but this doesn’t mean that a set of responses to these questions constitutes research! The development, administration, analysis and reporting of questionnaire studies is at least as challenging as the other research approaches described in other chapters in this book. Questionnaire researchers are a disparate bunch, and have not yet agreed on a structured reporting format comparable to CONSORT (RCTs), QUORUM or PRISMA (systematic reviews) and AGREE.

# Papers that report questionnaire research

(guidelines). While a number of suggested structured tools, each designed for slightly different purposes, are now available [4–8], a review of such tools found little consensus and many unanswered questions [6]. I suspect that as such guides come to be standardised and more widely used, papers describing questionnaire research will become more consistent and easier to appraise.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Collect the next five questionnaires you are asked to fill out. These can be anything from an evaluation form in a restaurant to a student or staff satisfaction questionnaire – or even something that pops up on email. Answer these questions for each. What do you think the purpose of the questionnaire was? What do you think of the sampling frame? Did the questionnaire items cover everything you felt was relevant? Did closed‐item questions offer appropriate response options? Was the instrument visually appealing and easily navigable? In what way might flaws in the design have led to biased findings? How would you redesign it?
2. Take a look at this survey of medical and law students’ consumption of alcohol and recreational drugs [19]. Using the list of questions in the previous exercise (or, if you prefer, the more extensive list in Appendix 1), critically appraise the paper. How far do you trust the conclusions?

# Chapter 14 Papers that report quality improvement case studies

What are quality improvement studies, and how should we research them? The British Medical Journal (www.bmj.com) mainly publishes research articles. Another leading journal, BMJ Quality and Safety (https://qualitysafety.bmj.com), mainly publishes descriptions of initiatives to improve the quality and safety of healthcare, often in real-world settings such as hospital wards or general practices. If you are studying for an undergraduate exam, you should ask your tutors whether quality improvement studies are going to feature in your exams, because the material covered here is more often contained in postgraduate courses and you may find that it’s not on your syllabus. If that is the case, put this chapter aside for after you’ve passed – you will certainly need it when you are working full time in the real world!

A key way of improving quality is to implement the findings of research and make care more evidence-based. This is discussed in my book How to Implement Evidence-Based Healthcare. But achieving a high-quality and safe health service requires more than evidence-based practice. Think of the last time you or one of your relatives attended a general practitioner (GP) or were admitted to hospital. I’m sure you wanted to have the most accurate diagnostic tests (Chapter 8), the most efficacious drugs (Chapter 6) or non-drug interventions (Chapter 7) and you also wanted the clinicians to follow evidence-based care plans and guidelines (Chapter 10) based on systematic reviews (Chapter 9). Furthermore, if the hospital asked you to help evaluate the service, you would have wanted them to use a valid and reliable questionnaire (Chapter 13).

But did you also care about things like how long you had to wait for an outpatient appointment and/or your operation, the attitudes of staff, the clarity and completeness of the information you were given, the risk of catching an

infection (e.g. when staff didn’t wash their hands consistently) and the general efficiency of the place? If a member of staff made an error, was this openly disclosed to you and an unreserved apology offered? And if this happened, did the organisation have systems in place to learn from what went wrong and ensure it didn’t happen again to someone else? A ‘quality’ healthcare experience includes all these things and more. The science of quality improvement draws its evidence from many different disciplines including research on manufacturing and air traffic control as well as evidence-based medicine [3–5].

Improving quality and safety in a particular area of healthcare typically involves a complex project lasting at least a few months, with input from different staff members (and increasingly, patients and their representatives too) [6]. The leaders of the project help everyone involved set a goal and work towards it. The fortunes of the project are typically mixed – some things go well, other things not so well, and the initiative is typically written up (if at all) as a story.

For several years now, BMJ and BMJ Quality & Safety have distinguished research papers (presented as IMRAD – Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion) from quality improvement reports (presented as COMPASEN – Context, Outline of problem, Measures, Process, Analysis, Strategy for change, Effects of change and Next steps). In making this distinction, research might be defined as systematic and focused enquiry seeking truths that are transferable beyond the setting in which they were generated, while quality improvement might be defined as real-time, real-world work undertaken by teams who deliver services.

You might have spotted that there is a large grey zone between these two activities. Some of this grey zone is quality improvement research – that is, applied research aimed at building the evidence base on how we should go about quality improvement studies. Quality improvement research embraces a broad range of methods including most of the ones described in the other chapters – see the review by Portela et al. [7] for the many different study types used in improvement research. In particular, the mixed method case study incorporates both quantitative data (e.g. measures of the prevalence of a particular condition or problem) and qualitative data (e.g. a careful analysis of the themes raised in complaint letters, or participant observation of staff going about their duties), all written up in an over-arching story about what was done, why, when, by whom and what the consequences were. If the paper is true quality improvement research, it should include a conclusion that offers transferable lessons for other teams in other settings [8,9].

Incidentally, while the story (‘anecdote’) is rightly seen as a weak study design when, say, evaluating the efficacy of a drug, the story format (‘organisational case study’) has unique advantages when the task is to pull together a great deal of complex data and make sense of it, as is the case when an organisation sets out to improve its performance [10].

As you can probably imagine, critical appraisal of quality improvement research is a particularly challenging area. Unlike in randomised trials, there are no hard and fast rules on what the ‘best’ approach to a quality improvement initiative should be, and a great deal of subjective judgements may need to be made about the methods used and the significance of the findings. But, as with all critical appraisal, the more papers you read and appraise, the better you will get.

In preparing the list of questions in the next section, I have drawn heavily on the SQUIRE (Standards for QUality Improvement Reporting Excellence) guidelines, which are the equivalent of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) and so on for quality improvement studies [11]. I was peripherally involved in the development of the original version of these guidelines, and I can confirm that they went through multiple iterations and struggles before appearing in print. This is because of the inherent challenges of producing structured checklists for appraising complex, multifaceted studies. To quote from the original paper by the SQUIRE development group (Davidoff et al. [12], p. 670):

Unlike conceptually neat and procedurally unambiguous interventions, such as drugs, tests, and procedures, that directly affect the biology of disease and are the objects of study in most clinical research, improvement is essentially a social process. Improvement is an applied science rather than an academic discipline; its immediate purpose is to change human performance rather than generate new, generalizable knowledge, and it is driven primarily by experiential learning. Like other social processes, improvement is inherently context‐dependent. […] Although traditional experimental and quasiexperimental methods are important for learning whether improvement interventions change behaviour, they do not provide appropriate and effective methods for addressing the crucial pragmatic … questions [such as] What is it about the mechanism of a particular intervention that works, for whom does it work, and under what circumstances?

With these caveats in mind, let’s see how far we can get with a checklist of questions to help make sense of quality improvement studies.

# Ten questions to ask about a paper describing a quality improvement initiative

After I developed the following questions, I applied them to two published quality improvement studies, both of which I thought had some positive features but which might have scored even higher if the SQUIRE guidelines had

How to read a paper

Been published when they were being written up. You might like to track down the papers and follow the examples. One is a study by Verdú et al. [13] from Spain, who wanted to improve the management of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in hospital patients; and the other is a study by May et al. [14] from the USA, who sought to use academic detailing (which Wikipedia defines as ‘non‐commercially based educational outreach’, see Chapter 6 ‘“Evidence” and marketing’) to improve evidence‐based management of chronic illness in a primary care setting.

Question One: What was the context?

‘Context’ is the local detail of the real‐world setting in which the work happened. Most obviously, one of our example studies happened in Spain, the other in the USA. One was in secondary care and the other in primary care. We will not be able to understand how these different initiatives unfolded without some background on the country, the healthcare system and (at a more local level) the particular historical, cultural, economic and micro‐political aspects of our ‘case’.

It is helpful, for example, not only to know that May et al.’s academic detailing study was targeted at private GPs in the USA but also to read their brief description of the particular part of Kentucky where the doctors practised: ‘This area has a regional metropolitan demography reflecting a considerable proportion of middle America (… population 260 512, median household income US $39 813, 19% non‐White, 13% below the poverty line, one city, five rural communities and five historically black rural hamlets)’ [14]. So this was an area – ‘middle America’ – which, overall, was neither especially affluent nor especially deprived, which included both urban and rural areas, and which was ethnically mixed but not dramatically so.

Question Two: What was the aim of the study?

It goes without saying that the aim of a quality improvement study is to improve quality. Perhaps the best way of framing this question is ‘What was the problem for which the quality improvement initiative was seen as a solution?’

In Verdú et al.’s [13] DVT example, the authors are quite upfront that the aim of their quality improvement initiative was to save money. More specifically, they sought to reduce the time patients spent in hospital (‘length of stay’). In the academic detailing example, a ‘rep’ (UK terminology) or ‘detailer’ (US terminology) visited doctors to provide unbiased education and, in particular, to provide evidence‐based guidelines for the management of diabetes (first visit) and chronic pain (second visit). The aim was to see whether the academic detailing model, which had been shown as long ago as 1983 to improve practice in research trials [14], could be made to work in the messier and less predictable environment of real‐world middle America.

Question Three: What was the mechanism by which the authors hoped to improve quality?

This how question is all-important. Look back to Chapter 7 on complex interventions, when I asked (Question Four) ‘What was the theoretical mechanism of action of the intervention?’ This is effectively the same question, although quality improvement initiatives typically have fuzzy boundaries and you should not necessarily expect to identify a clear ‘core’ to the intervention.

In the DVT care pathway example, the logic behind the initiative was that if they developed an integrated care pathway incorporating all the relevant evidence-based tests and treatments in the right order, stipulating who was responsible for each step, and excluding anything for which there was evidence of no benefit, staff would follow it. In consequence, the patient would spend less time in hospital and have fewer unnecessary procedures. Furthermore, sharpening up the pathway would, they hoped, also reduce adverse events (such as haemorrhage).

In the academic detailing example, the ‘mechanism’ for changing doctors’ prescribing behaviour was the principles of inter-personal influence and persuasion on which the pharmaceutical industry has built its marketing strategy (and which I spent much of Chapter 6 warning you about). Personally supplying the guidelines and talking the doctors through them would, it was hoped, increase the chance that the guidelines would be followed.

Question Four: Was the intended quality improvement initiative evidence-based?

Some measures aimed at improving quality seem like a good idea in theory but actually don’t work in practice. Perhaps the best example of this is mergers – that is, joining two small healthcare organisations (e.g. hospitals) with the aim of achieving efficiency savings, economies of scale, and so on. Fulop’s team [15] demonstrated that not only do such savings rarely materialise, but merged organisations often encounter new, unanticipated problems. In this example, there is not merely no evidence of benefit, but evidence that the initiative might cause harm.

In the DVT example, there is a systematic review demonstrating that overall, in the research setting, developing and implementing integrated care pathways (also known as critical care pathways) can reduce costs and length of stay [16]. Similarly, systematic reviews have confirmed the efficacy of academic detailing in research trials [17]. In both of our examples, then, the ‘can it work?’ question had been answered and the authors were asking a more specific and contextualised question: ‘does it work here, with these people and this particular set of constraints and contingencies?’ [18].

# Chapter 14

Question Five: How did the authors measure success, and was this reasonable?

At a recent conference, I wandered around a poster exhibition in which groups of evidence-based medicine enthusiasts were presenting their attempts to improve the quality of a service. I was impressed by some, but very disheartened to find that not uncommonly the authors had not formally measured the success of their initiative at all - or even defined what ‘success’ would look like!

Our two case examples did better. Verdú et al. evaluated their DVT study in terms of six outcomes: length of hospital stay, cost of the hospital care, and what they called as care indicators (the proportion of patients whose care actually followed the pathway; the proportion whose length of stay was actually reduced in line with the pathway’s recommendations; the rate of adverse events; and the level of patient satisfaction). Taken together, these gave a fair indication of whether the quality improvement initiative was a success. However, it was not perfect - for example, the satisfaction questionnaire would not have shaped up well against the criteria for a good questionnaire study in Chapter 13.

In the academic detailing example, a good measure of the success of the initiative would surely have been the extent to which the doctors followed the guidelines or (even better) the impact on patients’ health and well-being. But these downstream, patient-relevant outcome measures were not used. Instead, the authors’ definition of ‘success’ was much more modest: they simply wanted their evidence-based detailers to get a regular foot in the door of the private GPs. To that end, their outcome measures included the proportion of doctors in the area who agreed to be visited at all; the duration of the visit (being shown the door after 45 s would be a ‘failed’ visit); whether the doctor agreed to be seen on a second or subsequent occasion; and if so, whether he or she could readily locate the guidelines supplied at the first visit.

It could be argued that these measures are the equivalent of the ‘surrogate endpoints’ I discussed in Chapter 6. But, given the real-world context (a target group of geographically and professionally isolated private practitioners steeped in pharmaceutical industry advertising, for whom evidence-based practice was not traditionally part of their core business), a ‘foot in the door’ is much better than nothing. Nevertheless, when appraising the paper, we should be clear about the authors’ modest definition of success and interpret the conclusions accordingly.

Question Six: How much detail was given about the change process, and what insights can be gleaned from this?

The devil of a change effort is often in the nitty-gritty detail. In the DVT care pathway example, the methods section was fairly short and left me hungry for more. Although I liked many aspects of the paper, I was irritated by this briefest

of descriptions of what was actually done to develop the pathway: ‘After the design of the clinical pathway, we started the study…’. But who designed the pathway, and how? Experts in evidence‐based practice – or people working at the front line of care? Ideally, it would have been both, but we don’t know. Were just the doctors involved – or were nurses, pharmacists, patients and others (such as or the hospital’s director of finance) included in the process? Were there arguments about the evidence – or did everyone agree on what was needed? The more information about process we can find in the paper, the more we can interpret both positive and negative findings.

In the academic detailing example, the methods section is very long and includes details on how the programme of ‘detailing’ was developed, how the detailers were selected and trained, how the sample of doctors was chosen, how the detailers approached the doctors, what supporting materials were used, and how the detailing visits were structured and adapted to the needs and learning styles of different doctors. Whether we agree with their measures of the project’s success or not, we can certainly interpret the findings in the light of this detailed information on how they went about it.

The relatively short methods section in the DVT care pathway example may have been a victim of the word length requirements of the journal. Authors summarise their methods in order to appear succinct, and thereby leave out all the qualitative detail that would allow you to evaluate the process of quality improvement – that is, to build up a ‘rich picture’ of what the authors actually did. In recognition of this perverse incentive, the authors of the original SQUIRE guidelines issued a plea to editors for ‘longer papers’ [12]. A well‐written quality improvement study might run into a dozen or more pages, and it will generally take you a lot longer to read than, say, a tightly written report on a randomised trial. The increasing tendency for journals to include ‘eXtra’ (with the ‘e’ meaning ‘online’) material in an Internet‐accessible format is extremely encouraging, and you should hunt such material down whenever it is available.

Question Seven: What were the main findings? For this question you need to return to your answer to Question Five and find the numbers (for quantitative outcomes) or the key themes (for qualitative data), and ask whether and how these were significant. Just as in other study designs, ‘significance’ in quality improvement case studies is a multi‐faceted concept. A change in a numerical value can be clinically significant without being statistically significant or vice versa (see Chapter 5), and can also be vulnerable to various biases. For example, in a before and after study, time will have moved on between the ‘baseline’ and ‘post intervention’ measures, and a host of confounding variables including the economic climate, public attitudes, availability of particular drugs or procedures, relevant case

Law, and the identity of the chief executive, may have changed. Qualitative outcomes can be particularly vulnerable to the Hawthorne effect (staff tend to feel valued and work harder when any change in working conditions aimed at improving performance is introduced, whether it has any intrinsic merits or not) [19].

In the DVT care pathway example, mean length of stay was reduced by 2 days (a difference that was statistically significant), and financial savings were achieved of several hundred Euros per patient. Furthermore, 40 of 42 eligible patients were actually cared for using the new care pathway (a further 18 patients with DVT did not meet the inclusion criteria), and 62% of all patients achieved the target reduction in length of stay. Overall, 7 of 60 people experienced adverse events, and in only one of these had the care pathway been followed. These figures, taken together, not only tell us that the initiative achieved the goal of saving money, but they also give us a clear indication of the extent to which the intended changes in the process of care were achieved and remind us that many patients with DVT are what are known as exceptions – that is, management by a standardized pathway doesn’t suit their needs.

In the academic detailing example, the findings show that of the 130 doctors in the target group, 78% received at least one visit and these people did not differ in demographic characteristics (e.g. age, sex, whether qualified abroad or not) from those who refused a visit. Only one person refused point blank to receive further visits, but getting another visit scheduled proved challenging, and barriers were ‘primarily associated with persuading office staff of the physician’s stated intentions for further visits’. In other words, even though the doctor was (allegedly) keen, the detailers had trouble getting past the receptionists – surely a significant qualitative finding about the process of academic detailing, which had not been uncovered in the randomized trial design! Half the doctors could lay their hands on the guidelines at the second visit (and by implication, half couldn’t). But the paper also presented some questionable quantitative outcome data such as ‘around 90% of practitioners appeared interested in the topics discussed’ – an observation which, apart from being entirely subjective, is a Hawthorne effect until proved otherwise. Rather than using the dubious technique of trying to quantify their subjective impressions, perhaps the authors should have either stuck to their primary outcome measure (whether the doctors let them in the door or not) or gone the whole hog and measured compliance with the guidelines.

Question Eight: What was the explanation for the success, failure or mixed fortunes of the initiative, and was this reasonable?

Once again, conventions on the length of papers in journals can make this section frustratingly short. Ideally, the authors will have considered their

findings, revisited the contextual factors you identified in Question One, and offered a plausible and reasoned explanation for the former in terms of the latter, including a consideration of alternative explanations. More commonly, explanations are brief and speculative.

Why, for example, was it difficult for academic detailers to gain access to doctors for second appointments? According to the authors, the difficulty was because of ‘customarily short open‐diary times for future appointments and operational factors related to the lack of permanent funding for this service’. But an alternative explanation might have been that the doctor was disinterested but did not wish to be confrontational, so told the receptionists to stall if approached again!

As in this example, evaluating the explanations given in a paper for disappointing outcomes in a quality improvement project is always a judgement call. Nobody is going to be able to give you a checklist that will allow you to say with 100% accuracy ‘this explanation was definitely plausible, whereas that aspect definitely wasn’t’. In a quality improvement case study, the authors of the paper will have told a story about what happened, and you will have to interpret their story using your knowledge of evidence‐based medicine, your knowledge of people and organisations, and your common sense.

The DVT care pathway paper, while offering very positive findings, offers a realistic explanation of them: ‘The real impact of clinical pathways on length of stay is difficult to ascertain because these non-randomised, partly retrospective, studies might show significant reductions in hospital stay but cannot prove that the only cause of the reduction is the clinical pathway.’ Absolutely!

# Question Nine: In the light of the findings, what do the authors feel are the next steps in the quality improvement cycle locally?

Quality is not a station you arrive at but a manner of travelling. (If you want a reference for that statement, the best I can offer is Pirsig’s [20] Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.) To put it another way, quality improvement is a never-ending cycle: when you reach one goal, you set yourself another.

The DVT care pathway team were pleased that they had significantly reduced length of stay, and felt that the way to improve further was to ensure that the care pathway was modified promptly as new evidence and new technologies became available. Another approach, which they did not mention but which would not need to wait for an innovation, might be to apply the care pathway approach to a different medical or surgical condition.

The academic detailing team decided that their next step would be to change the curriculum slightly so that rather than covering two unrelated topics on different topic areas, they would use ‘judicious selection of sequential topics allowing subtle reflection of key message elements from previous

Encounters (e.g. management of diabetes followed by a programme on management of hypertension)’. It is interesting that they did not consider addressing the problem of attrition (42% of doctors did not make themselves available for the second visit).

Question Ten: What did the authors claim to be the generalisable lessons for other teams, and was this reasonable?

At the beginning of this chapter, I argued that the hallmark of research was generalisable lessons for others. There is nothing wrong with improving quality locally without seeking to generate wider lessons, but if the authors have published their work, they are often claiming that others should follow their approach – or at least, selected aspects of it.

In the DVT care pathway example, the authors make no claims about the transferability of their findings. Their sample size was small, and care pathways have already been shown to shorten hospital stay in other comparable conditions. Their reason for publishing appears to convey the message, ‘If we could do it, so can you!’

In the academic detailing example, the potentially transferable finding was said to be that a whole population approach to academic detailing (i.e. seeking access to every GP in a particular geographical area) as opposed to only targeting volunteers, can ‘work’. This claim could be true, but because the outcome measures were subjective and not directly relevant to patients, this study fell short of demonstrating it.

Conclusions

In this chapter, I have tried to guide you through how to make judgements about papers on quality improvement studies. As the quote at the end of section ‘What are quality improvement studies, and how should we research them?’ illustrates, such judgements are inherently difficult to make and require you to integrate evidence and information from multiple sources. Hence, while quality improvement studies are often small, local and even somewhat parochial, critically appraising such studies is often more of a headache than appraising a large meta‐analysis!

# Chapter 15 Papers that describe genetic association studies

The three eras of human genetic studies (so far) Beginning even before the discovery of DNA as the genetic code in 1953, there have been three main eras of genetic studies into human disease. The first era might be called ‘genetics without the genes’ – most famously, family tree studies of Mendelian (single mutated gene) disorders. This research consisted of mapping the family trees of people with a particular condition, and working out by default whether the condition was dominant or recessive, and sex‐linked or not. As a carrier of colour blindness myself (and the granddaughter, sister and mother of men with this X‐linked recessive condition), I could bore you with the details of such studies. But they are of largely historical interest these days, because the inheritance of most single‐gene diseases has long been completed and the early studies did not study the actual genes; they merely inferred the genetic problem from the phenotypes of the humans involved. Examples of single‐gene diseases include sickle cell anaemia (autosomal recessive), polycystic kidney disease (autosomal dominant), Rett’s syndrome (X‐linked dominant), colour blindness (X‐linked recessive) and a rare form of azoospermia (Y‐linked dominant).

The second era in human genetic research, beginning in the 1980s, was what I call ‘labour‐intensive gene mapping’. At that time, mapping actual genes on to their chromosomes was a laborious, expensive and painfully slow process involving the use of DNA ‘probes’ whose biochemical detail, based on the Southern blot technique, is now largely relegated to science history. The first disease to be mapped to a particular place (‘locus’) on a particular chromosome was Huntington’s, an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative condition first described in 1872. It was not until 1983 that the gene for Huntington’s was mapped to a section of chromosome 4 (part of a wider initiative to map the entire human genome) – and it

Took ten more years of manual DNA probe work to identify the exact mutation in the Huntington’s gene. The labour‐intensive era of genetic research often included genetic linkage studies, in which two or more traits carried on the same chromosome were explored in all consenting members of a family, usually with a view to identifying (indirectly) whether someone was likely to be carrying a genetic disease before they showed signs of it [4]. Techniques for single‐gene mapping have become much faster and now tend to use the automated polymerase chain reaction (see a genetics textbook for more detail).

The third era in human genetics research, and the one that requires me to add this chapter, began around 2005. It has been characterised by dramatic improvements in the efficiency of gene mapping, allowing researchers to study hundreds of genes at once in a cost‐effective way. A major focus of such research is the study of genetic polymorphisms – that is, the variations in genes that can account for person‐to‐person differences in susceptibility to disease (and also, for example, sensitivity to particular drugs).

Whereas everyone either has Huntington’s disease or does not, depending on whether they possess a single mutated gene, there is a wide range of different levels of serum cholesterol in the population, and every smoker would react a little differently if they applied a nicotine patch in an attempt to stop smoking. These are both examples of variations in our phenotype that stem at least partly from variations (as opposed to mutations) in our genetic make‐up.

If, as is usually the case, these variations are limited to a single genetic locus or allele, they are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (abbreviated to SNPs, pronounced ‘snips’). For example, a particular SNP might replace the nucleotide base thymine (T) with cytosine (C) in a certain stretch of DNA. (Remember those bases from your biochemistry class? If not, don’t feel the need to memorise them. The point to note is that genes vary in effect because of tiny variations in their molecular structure.) We all have thousands of SNPs, most of which do us no harm and are not linked to disease. SNPs can occur on the genes themselves, on the linking DNA between genes and on the bits of DNA that regulate genes.

Some SNPs act as biological markers (‘biomarkers’ for short), helping researchers locate genes that are associated with a disease or risk state. Which brings me to the type of study I want to spend most of this chapter talking about: the genome‐wide association study.

# What is a genome‐wide association study (GWAS)?

A GWAS is a very large cohort or case–control study which seeks to identify multiple small genomic variations (usually SNPs) that occur more frequently in people with a particular disease or risk state than in those without it [5].

# Papers that describe genetic association studies

By examining SNPs across the entirety of the genome, GWAS help improve our understanding of why some people develop diseases when others don’t.

Chapter 15

(Remember the advertisement for the heart disease charity in which the thin guy had heart disease while the fat guy escaped it? The former probably had an adverse set of SNPs for this condition.) GWAS have identified SNPs related to numerous conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, various heart abnormalities, Parkinson’s disease and Crohn’s disease.

To carry out a GWAS, researchers obtain DNA from each participant (both cases and controls), usually by taking a blood sample or swabbing the inside of the mouth to harvest cells. Each person’s complete genome is then purified from the blood or cells, placed on tiny chips (‘microarrays’) and scanned on automated laboratory machines, allowing it to be quickly assessed for strategically selected SNPs (I’m told by genetic experts that other approaches to identify SNPs, such as RNA sequencing, are on the horizon to replace microarrays). Typically, a GWAS study involves thousands of participants and hundreds of SNPs measured on each of them, so substantial computer power is needed (not to mention fancy statistics). For this reason, GWAS research tends to be interdisciplinary, involving geneticists, epidemiologists, computer scientists and statisticians as well as clinical specialists.

GWAS are examples of observational studies (see Chapter 3). They take a large sample of people and measure things in them, either comparing people with a disease to controls without the disease (if it’s something you either have or don’t have, such as sickle cell disease) or comparing a continuous variable across a population (e.g. cholesterol level, which isn’t something you either have or don’t have). In both kinds of study, researchers look at the strength of associations between SNPs and the target disease(s) or risk state(s). As Kevin Mitchell points out in his excellent ‘Wiring the Brain’ blog, ‘GWAS are premised on the simple idea that if any of those common variants at any of those millions of SNPs across the genome is associated with an increased risk of disease, then that variant should be more frequent in cases than in controls’ [6].

GWAS demonstrate the strength of association between gene variants, which can be either common or rare (‘allele frequency’, the x‐axis in Figure 15.1), and diseases, which can be either monogenic (single‐gene or Mendelian, e.g. cystic fibrosis) or polygenic (many genes, e.g. heart disease). These associations can be strong, weak or in between (‘effect size’, the y‐axis in Figure 15.1). Mendelian diseases involve mutations (very rare variants) and the associated SNPs have a very high effect size. Some forms of Alzheimer’s disease are associated with a common SNP with a large effect size. Most genetic associations discovered to date with implications for human health lie in the zone between the dashed diagonals in Figure 15.1: fairly common SNP variants with small to moderate effect sizes.

If certain SNPs are found to be significantly more frequent in people with the disease compared to people without disease (or people with high levels of a risk factor compared to those with low levels), this does not necessarily mean these SNPs cause the disease (or even contribute to its cause), because association does not prove causation (see Chapter 3). The associated SNPs may just be tagging along on the same chromosome with the actual causal variants. Because they sit close together on the string of DNA, they get passed on together to the next generation – something geneticists call ‘linkage disequilibrium’. Figure 15.2 illustrates how a SNP that is the focus of a GWAS (and is statistically associated with the disease) may not actually be the cause of that disease.

Much work therefore needs to be done to demonstrate the biological plausibility of associations highlighted by GWAS. In some but not all cases, such plausibility has indeed been demonstrated. For example, GWAS have implicated skeletal genes in height, immune genes in immune disorders, and neurodevelopmental genes in schizophrenia [6].

GWAS studies have their own databases (a bit like the Cochrane Library) which you can search for associations (either proven or disproven) – see for example the Database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP) located in the

US National Library of Medicine (part of the PubMed database) [7]. There’s often no point in doing a GWAS study to test a hypothesis that someone else has already confirmed or refuted in a particular population. And GWAS, like all primary research studies, can be synthesised in systematic reviews and meta-analyses (now there’s a new challenge for the methodologists).

An unanswered question widely discussed in genetics circles concerns ‘missing heritability’ – the fact that despite powerful techniques for demonstrating associations between SNPs and disease, in most diseases genetic variability appears to account for a relatively small percentage of the inter-individual phenotypic variation. For example, even if you do carry numerous ‘genes for heart disease’ (or, more accurately, SNPs that have been associated with heart disease), you may never develop it, and people who lack the incriminating SNPs can nevertheless develop heart disease [8]. As genetics gets more sophisticated, the level missing heritability for some diseases seems to be falling (although not for all diseases and not as quickly as some researchers hoped – for complex reasons including gene-environment interaction).

For a more detailed account of the place of GWAS studies in medicine, see the excellent introduction by Bush and Moore [5] and more recent reviews by Gibson [9] and Bomba et al. [10], which explain in more detail why and how thousands of small-effect SNP variants contribute to chronic disease.

# Clinical applications of GWAS

If you have read the previous section with a critical eye, you will be aware that even after a GWAS has shown that a particular SNP makes a person more likely to develop a particular condition than someone without that SNP, it does not mean that they will develop that condition. Indeed, you will have noted that most associations between particular SNPs and disease are weak.
---
# Chapter 15208 How to read a paper

It follows that GWAS might be high‐tech but this kind of study will always remain an inexact science when applied to the individual. While we should be circumspect about the potential of genetics to transform all aspects of clinical practice, the genetic revolution is by no means science fiction. An example you might like to explore is the discovery, through a GWAS, of a rare ‘mis‐sense’ SNP (a substituted piece of DNA that made a piece of the genetic code read as gobbledygook and hence fail to produce a particular protein, PSCK9) which was associated with a reduced risk of heart attack in people who carried it [11]. Lucky for those rare individuals. But here’s the bigger story: this GWAS informed a programme of research to try to achieve the same pathway of risk reduction in people without the lucky mis‐sense SNP, which led to the development of a new class of highly effective low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering therapies [12,13]. These drugs were developed primarily for people with familial hypercholesterolaemia whose underlying problem is that they overproduce PCSK9, although they also work for anyone with a high LDL level. Drugs such as alirocumab and evolocumab are monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 – a protein whose malign function would never have been discovered if it hadn’t been for the GWAS that trawled thousands of SNPs. Ain’t science grand?

Another clinical application of GWAS studies is in improving risk scores for diseases so as to target screening and/or preventive measures to those at increased risk. You are probably familiar with risk scores (typically presented as an app) that ask you to input certain features of your family history and symptoms to predict whether you are at high, medium or low risk of developing a particular disease. ‘Under the bonnet’ of such applications is a computer algorithm that attaches particular weight to different risk factors. A few years ago, my PhD student Dougy Noble and I (with some colleagues) looked at risk scores for type 2 diabetes [14]. We found that almost 100 different research teams had played with different weightings on the standard risk factors of age, family history, ethnicity, body mass index, fasting glucose level, cholesterol level and so on, and that quite a few had produced algorithms that weren’t bad (although they weren’t perfect) at predicting who was going to go on to develop diabetes.

At the time (2011), we found only a handful of diabetes risk score studies that had included any genetic data. Findings from those studies were consistent, and led us to conclude that ‘genetic markers added nothing to models over clinical and sociodemographic factors’, although we recognised that future research might identify additional genetic variants to improve the predictive power. We were not steeped in the language of genetics, so at the time we did not describe this as a problem of ‘missing heritability’. But to genetic epidemiologists, that’s exactly what it was, and much research since has

# Papers that describe genetic association studies

Focused on hunting out the dozens of SNPs, each of which has a minuscule influence on the overall risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

# Chapter 15

Depending on your enthusiasm for genetics, this glass is currently either half‐empty or half‐full [15]. A recent empirical study from Sweden found that adding genetics data only improved the predictability of the risk score for type 2 diabetes by 1% [16], which is considerably less additional data than you’d get by factoring in their postcode (a proxy for poverty, which is linked to lifestyle risk factors). On the other hand, Khera and colleagues used the very latest genetic data to identify a subset of 3.5% of the population who have a more than threefold increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes [17]. These authors suggest that genetic data from GWAS has now reached a stage of maturity that ‘polygenic risk scores’ for a number of common diseases, type 2 diabetes included, can be used in clinical practice. The same paper identified 8% and 6% of the population at threefold higher risk of coronary heart disease and atrial fibrillation, respectively.

The glass half‐empty argument for clinical applicability of genetic association studies says that measuring patients’ SNPs rarely gives you more information than examining the patient and taking a good family and social history (e.g. finding that a person has a body mass index of 35, a parent with type 2 diabetes and a personal history of gestational diabetes should give you enough information to recommend a diabetes prevention programme). This argument probably still holds for many common polygenic diseases where the offending SNPs have a weak effect – the bottom right area in Figure 15.1 – but there is growing evidence that for many rare diseases (e.g. Crohn’s), SNPs are better predictors of the condition than a family history [18].

# Direct‐to‐consumer genetic testing

In Chapter 6, I warned of the dangers of direct‐to‐consumer advertising of drugs. Marketing is based on the science of psychological influence; when it’s done well, it works. Because it is now cheap to sequence a genome, private companies are offering whole‐genome sequencing to the general public, and thousands of people are paying out (currently a few hundred pounds) and sending off a saliva swab to obtain a report on their risk of developing various diseases (along with various non‐disease data such as the proportion of Jewish – or indeed Neanderthal – ancestry in the person’s genome).

In many cases, the disease predictions (and reassurances) offered by these packages have been mis‐sold, for four reasons. First and foremost, because as I explained above, SNPs typically provide very weak associations, not firm predictions. Second, because many of the predictions provided by such companies about what might happen based on genetic associations are less

TC Timothy, based on your genetics and other factors, you are likely to get fewer mosquito bites than others.

Useful that the person’s actual knowledge of what has happened. Figure 15.3 (reproduced with permission from a colleague I met on social media) shows part of a genetic profile. As Timothy commented, he gets his full share of mosquito bites!

Third, because a focus on genes can distract people away from lifestyle risk factors that are far more powerful predictors of their likelihood of developing disease (smoking, alcohol and lack of exercise spring to mind). And finally, because like any output of a ‘big data’ study (in this case, a vast amount of data on a single individual), the findings are not self-interpreting. The lay person who (in good faith) sends off their specimen and a few weeks later receives a multipage printout of risk ratios will generally need help to work out what these findings mean. If the data are misinterpreted, that individual can become confused, anxious, fatalistic, angry or any combination of the above.

For all these reasons, private ‘sequence-your-genome’ services are often viewed as a particularly sinister genre in the wider problem of direct-to-consumer-advertising, and regulatory bodies are (rightly in my view) trying to keep a check on their activities. See these articles for the story of how the US Food and Drug Administration took on the private provider 23andMe [19,20].

Mendelian randomisation studies

As Chapter 3 argued, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are a good design for reducing (and in some senses eliminating) bias. But they are expensive, time-consuming and laborious. Another kind of randomization happens during cell division in the reproductive cycle: the random allocation of genes, since each egg cell and sperm cell contain half the genetic material of the parent cell. Here’s an example. My two adult sons both have the same parents and were fed similar diets as children, but are very different heights. By chance, one son inherited several gene variants for tallness while the other inherited gene variants for average height. They weren’t randomised by a researcher to receive more or fewer tallness genes, but Mother Nature allocated those genes unevenly between them. Both my sons are healthy, but if the taller son develops a disease (say, prostate cancer) in the future, might this be because of his height (or the SNPs he inherited that are linked to tall stature)?
---
# Papers that describe genetic association studies

(Genes for) height causing disease? I agree, it’s not terribly intuitive, but stay with me. Epidemiological studies have shown that tall men are slightly but significantly more likely to develop prostate cancer and that there is a ‘dose–response’ effect (the taller you are, the worse your chances) [21]. But is this because the genes for tallness also cause prostate cancer or because some environmental variable (say, something in the diet) causes both tallness and cancer?

Here’s where Mendelian randomisation comes in. Neil Davies and colleagues took a sample of more than 20,000 men with prostate cancer and 20,000 without prostate cancer, and (using GWAS) looked at how genes for height were distributed between them [22]. As expected, taller men had more genes for tallness (although it’s worth noting that genes explained only 6.5% of the variance in height). But genes for tallness (as opposed to tallness itself) were not more common in the men with prostate cancer. This finding suggests that the link between height and prostate cancer (which is pretty weak anyway, so tall men please don’t fret) is due to an unmeasured environmental variable and not to a genetically linked mechanism.

The detail of Mendelian randomisation studies is beyond the scope of this book. They hold the potential to supplement the findings of RCTs and even occasionally make a conventional RCT unnecessary [23]. If you read only one paper on Mendelian randomisation studies, I recommend Neil Davies and colleagues’ recent paper ‘Reading Mendelian randomisation studies: a guide, glossary, and checklist for clinicians’ [24]. As they point out, the chief contribution of Mendelian randomisation is to use genetic variation as a natural experiment to investigate whether the relations between risk factors and health outcomes in observational data are causal or caused by an unmeasured confounding variable. These authors warn, however, that Mendelian randomisation depends on a number of assumptions, whose plausibility must be carefully assessed.

Epigenetics – a space to watch

While much is written about epigenetics, its clinical relevance is currently speculative, so this section is intentionally short.

If genetics is the study of genes, epigenetics is the study of how genes interact with the environment. Your genome, as you will remember from your Crick and Watson, is made of DNA (and, derivatively, RNA). Your epigenome is made up of chemical compounds and proteins that can attach to DNA and produce actions such as turning genes on or off, thereby controlling the production of proteins in particular cells.

The only epigenetic change to DNA that has been reliably documented to date is methylation. Methylated DNA (mDNA) is said to mediate the influence of environmental risk factors on the development of disease. Potentially, we
---
# Chapter 15212 How to read a paper

Could study environmental influences in terms of how effectively they lead to DNA methylation, and perhaps we can produce interventions to block such methylation even in the presence of environmental pressure. Hopeful review articles predict another revolution in the role of (epi)genetics in clinical care along these lines [25,26], and a critical appraisal checklist for epigenetic studies has been published [27]. But epigenetics also has its skeptics, who point out that the mismatch between the claims about what epigenetics could achieve and what it actually has achieved to date is wide [28,29]. Perhaps most troubling is the assumption that the study of societal and environmental influences on disease can and should be reduced to (or even primarily centered on) the study of molecular changes to DNA. Even if this is what mediates the complex influences of environment on human illness, that does not necessarily mean that interventions should be targeted at the molecular level. Not long ago, I reviewed a book by David Wastell (a skeptical neuroscientist) and Sue White (a social scientist) on the epigenetics of childhood disadvantage [30]. The book is worth reading as it tells two stories – the epigenetics of neurodevelopmental problems in disadvantaged children and the ‘social science of science’ (how studies of the social determinants of health have been overlooked as research funding is instead poured into the study of DNA methylation). Should we develop better ways of interfering with the methylation of DNA in the brains of children raised in extreme poverty – or should we channel resources into reducing poverty and its impact on young children? Read the book and decide for yourself.

Ten questions to ask about a genetic association study

Because this is an introductory textbook (and because I myself am no geneticist), I have not included a fully comprehensive checklist for exhaustively evaluating a GWAS or Mendelian randomization study. For more definitive checklists, see three articles in the Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature series [31–33], Sohani et al.’s Q‐Genie tool for genetic association studies [34], Iglesias et al.’s checklist for appraising genetic risk prediction studies (GRIPS) [35], Little et al.’s guidelines for reporting genetic association studies (STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association Studies or STREGA [36]) and Davies et al.’s review paper on Mendelian randomization [24]. For some elementary questions based on those papers to get you started, try these.

Question One: What was the research question, and to what extent was it hypothesis driven? Genetics studies these days rely on ‘big data’ – many observations on large numbers of participants. When the volume of data is large, and computers
---
# Papers that describe genetic association studies

make it relatively easy to test large numbers of statistical associations, researchers may be tempted to ‘data‐dredge’ – that is, to look for any significant associations before considering specific hypotheses or biological mechanisms. This is poor science, because the more associations you test, the more likely some will come out statistically significant by chance. For these reasons, before you dive straight into the dataset of a large genetic study, read the introductory section to assess the background to the study and the scientific plausibility of the associations that were being explored.

# Question Two: What was the population studied, and to what extent are the findings generalisable to other populations?

The vast majority of GWAS research to date has focused on white European and North American populations. Populations whose ancestors are traced to Africa, the Middle East or South Asia, for example, have different genetic make‐up (and, more specifically, they will differ in the frequency of risk alleles), so associations established to date may not apply to those populations. Questioning the ethnic representativeness of a population or sample is particularly important when considering diseases that are highly patterned by ethnicity (e.g. type 2 diabetes).

# Question Three: Did the GWAS meet the established methodological quality criteria for a cohort or case–control study?

Putting the high‐tech genetics component aside, much of what I wrote in Chapter 4 about methodological quality and Chapter 5 about statistics applies to GWAS and similar studies. In a case–control study, for example, cases should have the same characteristics as the control subjects except for the condition being studied. Comparing ‘cases’ recruited from hospital clinics with ‘controls’ recruited from a community database, for example, will tend to inflate the association. Ethnicity differences between cases and control subject can also produce significant biases (see Question Four). The study also needs to be adequately powered, of course. Because most SNP associations for common diseases are weak, GWAS usually need to be very large to establish statistically significant associations. You should find a power calculation (or at least, a justification of the sample size) somewhere in the methods section. Because genetic association studies are characterised by multiple comparisons, there is a substantial risk of finding significant associations by chance (type 1 error). There are ways of dealing with this – both statistical (e.g. use a p < 0.00001 rather than p < 0.05 level of significance, use a correction such as the Bonferroni calculation) and interpretive (for every association found, try to produce a plausible explanation and mechanism; if one cannot be produced, be circumspect about its significance).
---
# Chapter 15214 How to read a paper

Question Four: Were pe alleles of interest distributed as expected in pe population?
This is really a question about sampling bias (where what is being ‘sampled’ is pe genes). You may remember from your biology lessons someping called pe Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (sometimes abbreviated HWE). This means pat if a condition has two alleles (classically depicted A and a), and if everyone in pe population selects peir mates at random, pere will be a particular distribution of phenotypes in pat population. Of course, people don’t mate at random, which introduces a potential bias in pe findings of a genetic association study. Distortions to HWE occur, for example, prough inbreeding, migration, new mutations and selection (e.g. if one allele leads to reduced fertility).

Question Five: Were phenotypes defined precisely and using standardized criteria?
A particular problem in genetic association studies is unclear definitions of pe phenotypic characteristics pat are being explored. Whereas pe phenotypic manifestations of Mendelian diseases like sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis are usually readily distinguished, pose of polygenic conditions are continuous wip ‘normal’ (and may also be distorted by treatment effects). A clear and consistent definition of what counts as a phenotypic variant is essential. This is especially challenging when pe variable (such as cholesterol) is continuously distributed in pe population.

Question Six: How technically robust was pe genetic analysis?
As you might imagine, laboratory genetic testing is a sophisticated science, and not every lab is good at it. This is not pe place to go into detail of pe precise quality standards, but it’s worp noting pat poor laboratory standards can lead to two kinds of error. If genotypes are systematically misclassified in one direction or oper, pis will positively or negatively affect associations depending on pe direction of misclassification. If pe misclassifications occur non‐systematically, pis will bias association toward pe null. A way of getting at pis information is to see wheper any quality standards were defined in pe paper and how many samples were rejected as failing quality control.

Question Seven: Are pe findings consistent wip oper studies?
It is still fairly early days in building pe evidence base in genetic association studies. Some published studies are mepodologically poor, and some apparently robust studies have yet to be replicated. If pe study you are appraising seems to contradict oper evidence in pe literature, treat pe study cautiously (as you would for any oper study design).

# Papers that describe genetic association studies

Question Eight: How large and how precise are the associations?
If you have read the earlier chapters in this book, you already know that a Chapter 15 'statistically significant' finding is not necessarily clinically significant. This maxim is particularly relevant to a genetic study with a sample size of several thousand. Do I care if my risk of developing colon cancer is 1.05 times the population average, even if that is statistically significant? But I might care if my risk is 10 times the average.

Question Nine: Are the conclusions justified by the findings?
Some genetic epidemiologists are circumspect by nature; others are wont to over-egg the significance of their findings. More importantly perhaps, press releases and articles in the lay press based on genetic studies can vastly over-interpret the clinical significance of the findings. As John Attia and colleagues set out in their Users' Guides to the Medical Literature on genetic association studies, even genuinely positive results will initially tend to overestimate the significance of a genetic association (as they put it, 'The phenomenon, sometimes referred to as the winner's curse, arises because overestimates are more likely to cross threshold P values for declaring an association' (p. 305) [33]. When you study the conclusions of a genetic association study, consider whether the authors have considered this 'winner's curse' explanation for their findings.

Question Ten: What (if any) are the implications for patient care in my practice?
This is the common-sense 'so what?' question – and in my view it's relatively underexplored for a lot of conditions that are now said to be 'genetic' in origin. As the example of risk scores for type 2 diabetes illustrates, the findings from genetic association studies, even when statistically significant, sometimes add little or nothing to the predictive power of standard clinical variables such as fasting blood glucose, body mass index and a simple family history. When considering whether to offer the patient genetic testing for a particular allele, the clinician also needs to take account of the effect the news might have on the patient if the test is positive (or indeed, if the results come back equivocal). There is also the question of whether and how the genetic information would change the patient's management. If I am managing a 55-year-old person who is overweight, a smoker and has a strong family history of type 2 diabetes, am I going to change my clinical advice based on the results of genetic profiling? In a few clinical situations, I might do genetic testing to identify a rare variant with strong effect where the management would be influenced (e.g. referral to specialist clinic or selection of a particular drug), but for common variants with small effects, clinical management is rarely influenced.

# Conclusions

In conclusion, genetic association studies are a rapidly advancing field, and I learnt a lot from writing this chapter. But at the time of writing, clinical practice for most conditions has not changed dramatically as a result of these studies (although I’m told the question banks of multiple-choice exams have).

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Take a look at these articles describing polygenic risk scores for breast cancer [37], type 1 diabetes [38] and statin benefit in cardiovascular disease [39]. Would you submit to genetic testing to see if you were at higher than average risk of these conditions? If so, why (and if not, why not)? If you were found to be at higher risk on the basis of your genetic profile, what would you do to try to alter your outcome?
2. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with colon cancer. Get hold of the full text of the paper ‘Exploring causality in the association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and colorectal cancer risk: a large Mendelian randomisation study’ [40]. Read the paper with a critical eye, asking yourself why the authors consider that they have demonstrated that the relation between vitamin D levels and colon cancer is an association rather than a true causal link. What reasons can you think of for this association?

# Chapter 16 Applying evidence with patients

The patient perspective

There is no such thing as the patient perspective – and that is precisely the point of this chapter. At times in our lives, often more frequently the older we get, we are all patients. Some of us are also health professionals – but when the decision relates to our health, our medication, our operation, the side effects that we may or may not experience with a particular treatment, we look on that decision differently from when we make the same kind of decision in our professional role.

As you will know by now if you have read the earlier chapters of this book, evidence‐based healthcare (EBHC) is mainly about using some kind of population average – an odds ratio, a number needed to treat, an estimate of mean effect size and so on – to inform decisions. But very few of us will behave exactly like the point average on the graph: some will be more susceptible to benefit and some more susceptible to harm from a particular intervention (see Chapter 15 for some genetic reasons for this – but there are also personal, social and cultural reasons). And few of us will value a particular outcome to the same extent as a group average on, say, a standard gamble question (see Chapter 11).

The individual unique experience of being ill (or indeed being ‘at risk’ or classified as such) can be expressed in narrative terms: that is, a story can be told about it. And everyone’s story is different. The ‘same’ set of symptoms or piece of news will have a host of different meanings depending on who is experiencing them and what else is going on in their lives. The exercise of taking a history from a patient is an attempt to ‘tame’ this individual, idiosyncratic set of personal experiences and put it into a more or less standard format to align with the protocols for assessing, treating and preventing disease. Indeed, England’s first professor of general practice, Marshall Marinker, once said that the role of medicine is to distinguish the clear message of the disease from the interfering noise of the patient as a person.

How to read a paper

As I have written elsewhere, an ‘evidence‐based’ perspective on disease and the patient’s unique perspective on his or her illness ('narrative‐based medicine', if you like) are not at all incompatible [1]. It is worth going back to the original definition of evidence‐based medicine (EBM) proposed by Sackett and colleagues. This definition is reproduced in full, although only the first sentence is generally quoted.

Evidence based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. By individual clinical expertise we mean the proficiency and judgment that individual clinicians acquire through clinical experience and clinical practice. Increased expertise is reflected in many ways, but especially in more effective and efficient diagnosis and in the more thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients’ predicaments, rights, and preferences in making clinical decisions about their care. By best available external clinical evidence we mean clinically relevant research, often from the basic sciences of medicine, but especially from patient centred clinical research into the accuracy and precision of diagnostic tests (including the clinical examination), the power of prognostic markers, and the efficacy and safety of therapeutic, rehabilitative, and preventive regimens [2, p. 71].

Thus, while the original protagonists of EBM are sometimes wrongly depicted as having airbrushed the poor patient out of the script, they were actually very careful to depict EBM/EBHC as being contingent on patient choice (and, incidentally, as dependent on clinical judgement). The ‘best’ treatment is not necessarily the one shown to be most efficacious in randomised controlled trials but the one that fits a particular set of individual circumstances and aligns with the patient’s preferences and priorities.

The ‘evidence‐based’ approach is sometimes stereotypically depicted by the clinician who feels, for example, that every patient with a transient ischaemic attack should take warfarin because this is the most efficacious preventive therapy, whether or not the patients say they don’t want to take tablets, can’t face the side effects or feel that attending for a blood test every week to check their clotting function is not worth the hassle. A relative of mine was reluctant to take warfarin, for example, because she had been advised to stop eating grapefruit – a food she has enjoyed for breakfast for over 60 years but which contains chemicals that may interact with warfarin. I was pleased that her general practitioner (GP) invited her to come in and

Discuss the pros and cons of the different treatment options, so that her choice would be an informed one.

Almost all research in the EBM tradition between 1990 and 2010 focused on the epidemiological component and sought to build an evidence base of randomised controlled trials and other ‘methodologically robust’ research designs. Later, a tradition of ‘evidence‐based patient choice’ emerged in which the patient’s right to choose the option most appropriate and acceptable to them was formalised and systematically studied. The third component of EBM referred to in the quote – individual clinical judgement – has not been extensively theorised by scholars within the EBM tradition, although I have written about it myself.

Patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs)

Before we get into how to involve patients in individualising the decisions of EBHC, I want to introduce a relatively new approach to selecting the outcome measures used in clinical trials: patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs). Here’s a definition.

PROMs are the tools we use to gain insight from the perspective of the patient into how aspects of their health and the impact the disease and its treatment are perceived to be having on their lifestyle and subsequently their quality of life (QoL). They are typically self‐completed questionnaires, which can be completed by a patient or individual about themselves, or by others on their behalf.

By ‘outcome measure’ I mean the aspect of health or illness that researchers choose to measure to demonstrate (say) whether a treatment has been effective. Death is an outcome measure. So is blood pressure (although it’s a surrogate measure – see Chapter 6). So is the chance of leaving hospital with a live baby when you go into hospital in labour. So is the ability to walk upstairs or make a cup of tea on your own. I could go on – but the point is that in any study the researchers have to define what it is they are trying to influence.

PROMs are not individualised measures. On the contrary, they are still a form of population average but, unlike most outcome measures, they are an average of what matters most to patients rather than an average of what researchers or clinicians felt they ought to measure. The way to develop a PROM is to undertake an extensive phase of qualitative research (see Chapter 12) with a representative sample of people who have the condition you are interested in, analyse the qualitative data and then use it to design a

Survey instrument ('questionnaire', see Chapter 13) that captures all the key features of what patients are concerned about [6]. PROMs were (I believe) first popularised by a team in Oxford led by Ray Fitzpatrick, who used the concept to develop measures for assessing the success of hip and knee replacement surgery [7]. They are now used fairly routinely in many clinical topics in the wider field of 'outcomes research' [8–10]; and a recent monograph by the UK Kings Fund recommends their routine use in National Health Service decision-making [11]. The Journal of the American Medical Association have published a set of standards for PROMs [12].

Shared decision-making

Important though PROMs are, they only tell us what patients, on average, value most, not what the patient in front of us values most. To find that out, as I said back in Chapter 1, you would have to ask the patient. And there is now a science and a methodology for 'asking the patient' [3,13]. The science of shared decision-making began in the late 1990s as a quirky interest of some keen academic GPs, notably Glyn Elwyn and Adrian Edwards [14]. The idea is based on the notion of the patient as a rational chooser, able and willing (perhaps with support) to join in the deliberation over options and make an informed choice.

A challenge is maintaining equipoise – that is, holding back on what you feel the course of action should be and setting out the different options with the pros and cons presented objectively, so the patients can make their own decision [15,16]. Box 16.1 lists the competencies that clinicians need to practice shared decision-making with their patients.

The various instruments and tools to support shared decision-making have evolved over the years. At the very least, a decision aid would have a way of making the rather dry information of EBHC more accessible to a non-expert, for example by turning numerical data into diagrams and pictures. An example, shown in Figure 16.1, uses colors and simple icons to convey quantitative estimates of risk [16,17]. The ways of measuring the extent to which patients have been involved in a decision have also evolved [18]. Coulter and Collins [19] have produced an excellent guide, Making Shared Decision-Making a Reality, which sets out the characteristics of a really good decision aid (Box 16.2).

Increasingly commonly, decision aids are available online, allowing the patient to click through different steps in the decision algorithm (with or without support from a health professional). In my view, the best way to get your head round shared decision-making tools is to take a look at a few – and if possible, put them to use in practice. The UK National Health Service has a

Option grids

Studies using the ‘OPTION’ instrument suggest that patient involvement in evidence-based decision-making is not always as high as the idealists would like it to be [20]. These days, most health professionals are (allegedly) keen to share decisions with patients in principle, but qualitative and questionnaire research has shown that they perceive a number of barriers to doing so in practice, including time constraints and lack of applicability of the decision support model to the unique predicament of a particular patient [21].

It is relatively uncommon for doctors to refer patients to decision support

Decision aids are different from traditional patient information materials because they do not tell people what to do. Instead, they set out the facts and help people to deliberate about the options. They usually contain:

A description of the condition and symptoms;
The likely prognosis with and without treatment;
The treatment and self‐management support options and outcome probabilities;
What’s known from the evidence and not known (uncertainties);
Illustrations to help people understand what it would be like to experience some of the most frequent side effects or complications of the treatment options (often using patient interviews);
A means of helping people clarify their preferences;

websites, partly because they feel they are already sharing decisions in routine consultation, and partly because they feel that patients do not wish to be involved in this way [22].

The reality of a typical GP consultation, for example, is a long way from the objective reality of a formal decision algorithm. When a patient attends with symptoms suggestive of (say) sciatica, the doctor has 10 min to make progress. Typically, they will examine the patient, order some tests and then have a rather blurry conversation about how (on the one hand) the patient’s symptoms might resolve with physiotherapy but (on the other hand) they might like to see a specialist because some cases will need an operation. The patient typically expresses a vague preference for either conservative or interventionist management, and the doctor (respecting the ‘empowered’ views) goes along with the patient’s preference.

If the doctor is committed to evidence-based shared decision-making, he or she may try using a more structured approach to shared decision-making as set out in section ‘Shared decision-making’, for example, by logging on to an online algorithm or by using pie charts or pre-programmed spreadsheets to elicit numerical scores of how much the patient values particular procedures and outcomes vis-à-vis one another. But very often, such tools will have been tried once or twice and then abandoned as technocratic, time-consuming, overly quantitative and oddly disengaged from the unique personal illness narrative that fills the consultation.

The good news is that our colleagues working in the field of shared decision-making have recently acknowledged that the perfect may be the enemy of the good. Most discussions about management options in clinical practice do not require – and may even be thrown off kilter by – an exhaustive analysis of probabilities, risks and preference scores. What most people want is a brief but balanced list of the options, setting out the costs and benefits of each and including an answer to the question ‘what would happen if I went down this route?’

Enter the option grid (https://health.ebsco.com/products/option-grid): the product of a collaborative initiative between patients, doctors and academics [22]. An option grid is a one-page table covering a single topic (so far complete are sciatica, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer, tonsillitis and a dozen or so more). The grid lists the different options as columns, with each row answering a different question (such as ‘what does the treatment involve?’, ‘how soon would I feel better?’ and ‘how would this treatment affect my ability to work?’). An example is shown in Figure 16.2.

Option grids are developed in a similar way to PROMs, but there is often more of a focus on involvement of the multidisciplinary clinical team, as in this example of an option grid for head and neck cancer management [23]. The distinguishing feature of the option grid approach is that it promotes and

# Applying evidence with patients

Supports what has been termed option talk – that is, the discussions and deliberations around the different options [24]. The grids are, in effect, analogue rather than digital in design.

The reason I see this approach as progress from more algorithmic approaches to shared decision-making is that the information in an option grid is presented in a format that allows both reflection and dialogue. The grid can be printed off (or indeed, the patient can be given the url) and invited to go away and consider the options before returning for a further consultation. And unlike the previous generation of shared decision-making tools, neither the patient nor the clinician needs to be a ‘geek’ to use them.

# Chapter 16

The last approach to involving patients that I want to introduce in this chapter is the n of 1 trial. This is a very simple design in which each participant receives, in randomly allocated order, both the intervention and the control treatment [25].

An example is probably the best way to explain this. Back in 1994, some Australian GPs wanted to address the clinical issue of which painkiller to use in osteoarthritis [26]. Some patients, they felt, did fine on paracetamol (which has relatively few side effects), while others did not respond so well to paracetamol but obtained great relief from a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). In the normal clinical setting, one might try paracetamol first and move to the NSAID if the patient did not respond. But supposing there was a strong placebo effect? The patient might conceivably have limited confidence in paracetamol because it is such a commonplace drug, whereas an NSAID in a fancy package might be subconsciously favoured.

The idea of the n of 1 trial is that all treatments are anonymised, prepared in identical formulations and packaging, and just labelled ‘A’, ‘B’ and so on. The participants do not know which drug they are taking, hence their response is not influenced by whether they ‘believe in’ the treatment. To add to scientific rigour, the drugs may be taken in sequence such as ABAB or AABB, with ‘washout’ periods in between.

March and colleagues’ n of 1 trial of paracetamol versus NSAIDs did confirm the clinical hunch that some patients did markedly better on the NSAID but many did equally well on paracetamol. Importantly, unlike a standard randomised trial, the n of 1 design allowed the researchers to identify which patients were in each category. But the withdrawal rate from the trial was high, partly because when participants found a medication that worked, they just wanted to keep taking it rather than swap to the alternative!

How to read a paper

But despite its conceptual elegance and a distant promise of linking to the 'personalised medicine' paradigm in which every patient will have their tests and treatment options individualised to their particular genome, physiome, microbiome, and so on, the n of 1 trial has not caught on widely in either research or clinical practice. A review article by Lillie and colleagues [27] suggests this is because such trials are labour intensive to carry out, requiring a high degree of individual personalisation and large amounts of data for every participant. 'Washout' periods raise practical and ethical problems (does one have to endure one's arthritis with no pain relief for several weeks to serve the scientific endeavour?). Combining the findings from different participants raises statistical challenges. And the (conceptually simple) science of n of 1 trials has begun to get muddled up with the much more complex and uncertain science of personalised medicine.

In short, the n of 1 trial is a useful design (and one you may be asked about in exams!), but it is not the panacea it was once predicted to be. If you do an n of 1 trial yourself, don't forget to consult the CENT (CONSORT Extension for n of 1 trials) publication guidelines when writing it up [28].

A recent (and somewhat untested) alternative approach to individualising treatment regimens has been proposed recently by Moore and colleagues [29] in relation to pain relief. Their basic argument is that we should 'expect failure' (because the number needed to treat for many interventions is more than 2, statistically speaking any individual is more likely not to benefit than benefit) but 'pursue success' (because the 'average' for any intervention response masks a subgroup of responders who will do very well on that intervention). They propose a process of guided trial and error, systematically trying one intervention followed by another, until the one that works effectively for this patient is identified. Many front-line clinicians would probably agree with this strategy!

Exercises based on this chapter

1. Hallux valgus (usually known as bunion) surgery is widely undertaken but produces mixed results, with up to one-third of patients wishing they'd never had it done. Search the PubMed database for the paper by Schrier et al. [30] which reports a systematic review of outcome measures for hallux valgus surgery. List all the different outcome measures and explore how they were developed. How many of these measures are actually based on outcomes that patients themselves value? Which outcome measure would you want to use if you had this operation? Why?

On prescribing the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate in women who are (or could become) pregnant. The ‘ban’ was not absolute, because it was recognised that in certain difficult cases, valproate might be the only drug that would control the woman’s epilepsy or mental health condition. Al and I felt that because valproate has both benefits and potential harms, shared decision‐making using an option grid should be used to weigh up the pros and cons. When you have read the evidence in the paper, look carefully at our option grid. Do you think this grid will help or hinder productive conversations between women and their doctors?

# Chapter 17 Criticisms of evidence-based healthcare

What’s wrong with EBHC when it’s done badly? This chapter, which I wrote initially for the fifth edition of this book, became necessary because evidence-based healthcare (EBHC) had outlived its honeymoon period. There is, quite appropriately, a growing body of scholarship that offers legitimate criticisms of EBHC’s assumptions and core approaches. There is also a somewhat larger body of misinformed critique, and a grey zone of ‘anti-EBHC’ writing that contains more than a grain of truth but is itself one-sided and poorly argued. This chapter seeks to set out the legitimate criticisms and point the interested reader towards more in-depth arguments.

To inform this chapter, I initially drew on a number of sources, including a widely cited short article by Spence [1], a British Medical Journal (BMJ) columnist and common-sense general practitioner (GP); a book by Timmermans and Berg [2] The Gold Standard: The Challenge of Evidence-Based Medicine and Standardization in Health Care; a paper by Timmermans and Mauck [3] on the promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine (EBM); and Goldacre’s [4] book Bad Pharma.

To update this chapter for the sixth edition, I wove in arguments from a paper I wrote with colleagues, ‘Evidence based medicine – a movement in crisis?’ [5]. That paper was published in the BMJ in 2014 and has so far been cited over 1000 times, which suggests I’m not the only person to be interested in the flaws of EBHC as well as its benefits. However, it’s also worth pointing out that soon after I wrote the previous edition of this book, I developed a potentially life-threatening cancer and was treated (with surgery, chemotherapy and something called molecular targeted therapy) in accordance with the results of randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses and clinical practice guidelines. I’m now nearly four years from my diagnosis and have no signs of recurrence. So, before you interpret this chapter as

# Criticisms of evidence-based healthcare

An indication that I’ve lost faith in the evidence-based medicine movement, let me state loud and clear that I owe my life to it.

The first thing we need to get clear is the distinction between EBHC when it is practised badly (this section) and EBHC when it is practised well (next section). As a starter for this section, I am going to reproduce two paragraphs from the preface to this book, written for the first edition way back in 1995 and still unchanged in this sixth edition:

Many of the descriptions given by cynics of what evidence-based medicine is (the glorification of things that can be measured without regard for the usefulness or accuracy of what is measured, the uncritical acceptance of published numerical data, the preparation of all-encompassing guidelines by self-appointed ‘experts’ who are out of touch with real medicine, the debasement of clinical freedom through the imposition of rigid and dogmatic clinical protocols, and the over-reliance on simplistic, inappropriate, and often incorrect economic analyses) are actually criticisms of what the evidence-based medicine movement is fighting against, rather than of what it represents.

Do not, however, think of me as an evangelist for the gospel according to evidence-based medicine. I believe that the science of finding, evaluating and implementing the results of medical research can, and often does, make patient care more objective, more logical, and more cost-effective. If I didn’t believe that, I wouldn’t spend so much of my time teaching it and trying, as a general practitioner, to practise it. Nevertheless, I believe that when applied in a vacuum (that is, in the absence of common sense and without regard to the individual circumstances and priorities of the person being offered treatment or to the complex nature of clinical practice and policymaking), ‘evidence-based’ decision-making is a reductionist process with a real potential for harm.

Let’s unpack these issues further. What does ‘EBHC practised badly’ look like? If you follow me on Twitter, you may have seen a playful argument I got into with Carl Heneghan, Director of the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, on the difference between ‘real EBHC’ and ‘rubbish EBHC’. ‘Rubbish EBHC’ is EBHC practised badly. I tried, with some success, to get Carl to join the Campaign for Real EBHC.

First, rubbish EBHC cites numbers derived from population studies but asks no upstream questions about where those numbers (or studies) came from. If you have spent time on the wards or in general practice, you will know the type of person who tends to do this: a fast-talking, technically adept individual who appears to know the literature and how to access it.

# Chapter 17

(perhaps via apps on their state‐of‐the‐art tablet computer), and who always seems to have an NNT (number needed to treat) or odds ratio at his or her fingertips. But the fast talker is less skilled at justifying why this set of ‘evidence‐based’ figures should be privileged over some other set of figures. Their evidence, for example, may come from a single trial rather than a high‐quality and recent meta‐analysis of all available trials. Self‐appointed fast‐talking EBHC ‘experts’ tend to be unreflective (i.e. they don’t spend much time thinking deeply about things) and they rarely engage critically with the numbers they are citing. They may not, for example, have engaged with the arguments about surrogate endpoints I set out in Chapter 6.

Rubbish EBHC considers the world of published evidence to equate to the world of patient need. Hence, it commits two fallacies: it assumes that if (say) a randomised controlled trial (RCT) exists that tested a treatment for a ‘disease’, that disease is necessarily a real medical problem requiring treatment; and it also assumes that if ‘methodologically robust’ evidence does not exist on a topic, that topic is unimportant. This leads to a significant bias. The evidence base will accumulate in conditions that offer the promise of profit to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries – such as the detection, monitoring and management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease [6], the development and testing of new drug entities for diabetes [7], or the creation and treatment of non‐diseases such as ‘female hypoactive sexual desire’ [8]. Evidence will also accumulate in conditions that government chooses to recognise and prioritise for publicly funded research, but it will fail to accumulate (or will accumulate much more slowly) in Cinderella conditions that industry and/or government deem unimportant, hard to classify or ‘non‐medical’, such as multimorbidity [9] or physical activity in cardiovascular prevention [10].

Rubbish EBHC has little regard for the patient perspective and fails to acknowledge the significance of clinical judgement. As I pointed out in Chapter 16, the ‘best’ treatment is not necessarily the one shown to be most efficacious in RCTs but the one that fits a particular set of individual circumstances and aligns with the patient’s preferences and priorities.

Finally, rubbish EBHC draws on rubbish research – for example, research that has used weak sampling strategies, unjustified sample sizes, inappropriate comparators, statistical trick‐cycling, and so on. Chapter 6 set out some specific ways in which research (and the way it is presented) can mislead. While people behaving in this way will often claim to be members of the EBHC community (e.g. their papers may have ‘evidence‐based’ in the title), the more scholarly members of that community would strongly dispute such claims. Indeed, in our ‘movement in crisis’ paper, we gave examples of how the pharmaceutical industry has learnt to ‘game’ the quality standards and risk‐of‐bias tools beloved of the EBHC movement [6].

# Criticisms of evidence-based healthcare

What’s wrong with EBHC when it’s done well? While I worry as a clinician about EBHC done badly, the academic in me is more interested in its limitations when done well. This is because there are good philosophical reasons why EBHC will never be the fount of all knowledge.

A significant criticism of EBHC, highlighted by Timmermans and colleagues [2,3], is the extent to which EBHC is a formalised method for imposing an unjustifiable degree of standardisation and control over clinical practice. These authors argue that in the modern clinical world, EBM can be more or less equated with the production and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. ‘Yet’, argue Timmermans and Berg [2, p. 3], ‘such evidence is only rarely available to cover all the decision moments of a guideline. To fill in the blanks and to interpret conflicting statements that might exist in the literature, additional, less objective steps (such as consensus methods) are necessary to create a guideline’ [2].

Because of these (sometimes subtle) gaps in the research base, Timmermans and Berg contend that an ‘evidence-based’ guideline is usually not nearly as evidence-based as it appears to be. But the formalisation of the evidence into guidelines, which may then become ossified in protocols or computerised decision support programmes, lends an unjustified level of significance – and sometimes coercion – to the guideline. The rough edges are sanded down, the holes are filled in and the resulting recommendations start to acquire biblical significance!

One nasty side effect of this ossification is that yesterday’s best evidence drags down today’s guidelines and clinical pathways. An example is the lowering of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes. For many years, the ‘evidence-based’ assumption was that the more intensively a person’s blood glucose was controlled, the better the outcomes would be. But, more recently, a large meta-analysis showed that intensive glucose control had no benefit over moderate control, but was associated with a twofold increase in the incidence of severe hypoglycemia [11]. Yet for some years after it was published, UK GPs were still being performance-managed through a scheme called the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) to strive for intensive glucose control after the publication of that meta-analysis had shown an adverse benefit-harm ratio [12]. This is because it takes time for practice and policy to catch up with the evidence – but the existence of the QOF, introduced to make care more evidence-based, actually had the effect of making it less evidence-based!

Perhaps the most powerful criticism of EBHC is that, if misapplied, it dismisses the patient’s own perspective on the illness in favor of an average effect on a population sample or a column of quality-adjusted life-years.

(QALYs) (see Chapter 11) calculated by a medical statistician. Some writers on EBHC are enthusiastic about using a decision-tree approach to incorporate the patient’s perspective into an evidence-based treatment choice. In practice, this often proves impossible, because as I pointed out in Chapter 16, patients’ experiences are complex stories that refuse to be reduced to a tree of yes/no (or ‘therapy on, therapy off ’) decisions.

The (effective) imposition of standardized care reduces the clinician’s ability to respond to the idiosyncratic, here-and-now issues emerging in a particular consultation. The very core of the EBHC approach is to use a population average (or, more accurately, an average from a sample that is hopefully representative of the population) to inform decision-making for that patient. But, as many others before me have pointed out, a patient is not a mean or a median but an individual, whose illness inevitably has unique and unclassifiable features. Not only does overstandardization make the care offered less aligned to individual needs, it also de-skills the practitioner so that he or she loses the ability to customize and personalize care (or, in the case of recently trained clinicians, fails to gain that ability in the first place).

As Spence [1] put it, ‘Evidence engenders a sense of absolutism, but absolutism is to be feared absolutely. “I can’t go against the evidence” has produced our reductionist flowchart medicine, with thoughtless polypharmacy, especially in populations with comorbidity. Many thousands of people die directly from adverse drug reactions as a result.’

Let me give you another example. I recently undertook some research that required me to spend a long period of time watching junior doctors in an accident and emergency (A&E) department. I discovered that whenever a child was seen with an injury, the junior doctor completed a set of questions on the electronic patient’s record. These questions were based on an evidence-based guideline to rule out non-accidental injury. But because the young doctors filled these boxes for every child, it seemed to me that the ‘hunch’ that they might have had in the case of any particular child was absent. This standardized approach contrasted to my own junior doctor days 30 years ago, when we had no guidelines but spent quite a bit of our time honing our hunches.

Another concern about ‘EBHC done well’ is the sheer volume of evidence-based guidance and advice that now exists. As I pointed out in Chapter 10, the guidelines needed to manage the handful of patients seen on a typical 24-h acute take run to over 3000 pages and would require over a week of reading by a clinician [13]! And that does not include point-of-care prompting for other evidence-based interventions (e.g. risk factor management) in patients seen in a non-acute setting. For example, whenever I see a patient aged between 16 and 25 in general practice, a pop-up prompt tells me to ‘offer chlamydia screening’. Some of my own qualitative work with Swinglehurst

# Criticisms of evidence-based healthcare

et al. [14] has shown how disruptive such prompts are to the dynamic of the clinician-patient consultation.

A more philosophical criticism of EBHC is that it is predicated on a simplistic and naïve version of what knowledge is. The assumption is that knowledge can be equated with ‘facts’ derived from research studies that can be formalised into guidelines and ‘translated’ (i.e. implemented by practitioners and policymakers). But, as I have argued elsewhere, knowledge is a complex and uncertain beast [15]. For one thing, only some knowledge can be thought of as something an individual can know as a ‘fact’; there is another level of knowledge that is collective – that is, socially shared and organizationally embedded [16]. As Tsoukas and Vladimirou [17] put it:

Knowledge is a flux mix of framed experiences, values, contextual information and expert insight that provides a framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. It originates and is applied in the minds of knowers. In organizations, it often becomes embedded not only in documents or repositories but also in organizational routines, processes, practices, and norms.

Gabbay and May [18] illustrated this collective element of knowledge in their study that I mentioned briefly in Chapter 10. While these researchers, who watched GPs in action for several months, never observed the doctors consulting guidelines directly, they did observe them discussing and negotiating these guidelines among themselves and also acting in a way that showed they had somehow absorbed and come to embody the key components of many evidence-based guidelines ‘by osmosis’. These collectively embodied, socially shared elements of guidelines are what Gabbay and May called mindlines.

Facts held by individuals (e.g. a research finding that one person has discovered on a thorough literature search) can become collectivized through a variety of mechanisms, including efforts to make it relevant to colleagues (timely, salient, actionable), legitimate (credible, authoritative, reasonable) and accessible (available, understandable, assimilable) and to take account of the points of departure (assumptions, world views, priorities) of a particular audience.

These mechanisms reflect a body of research on the philosophy of knowledge – a major topic that is beyond the scope of this book. The key point here is that to present EBHC purely as the sequence of individual tasks set out in earlier chapters of this book is an oversimplistic depiction. If you are comfortable with the basics of EBHC, I strongly encourage you to go on to pursue the literature on these wider dimensions of knowledge [15–21].

Why is ‘evidence‐based policymaking’ so hard to achieve?

For some people, the main criticism of EBHC is that it fails to get evidence simply and logically into policy. And the reason why policies don’t flow simply and logically from research evidence is that there are so many other factors involved.

Take the question of publicly funded treatments for infertility, for example. You can produce a stack of evidence as high as a house to demonstrate that intervention X leads to a take‐home baby rate of Y% in women with characteristics (such as age or comorbidity) Z, but that won’t take the heat out of the decision to sanction infertility treatment from a limited healthcare budget. This was the question addressed by a Primary Care Trust policymaking forum I attended recently, which had to balance this decision against competing options (outreach support for first episode of psychosis and a community‐based diabetes specialist nurse for epilepsy). It wasn’t that the members of the forum ignored the evidence – there was so much evidence in the background papers that the courier couldn’t fit it through my letterbox – it was that values, rather than evidence, were what the final decision hung on. And as many have pointed out, policymaking is as much about the struggle to resolve conflicts of values in particular local or national contexts as it is about getting evidence into practice [22].

In other words, the policymaking process cannot be considered as a ‘macro’ version of the sequence depicted in Chapter 1 (see list in ‘Does ‘evidence‐based medicine’ simply mean ‘reading papers in medical journals’?). Like other processes that fall under the heading ‘politics’ (with a small ‘p’), policymaking is fundamentally about persuading one’s fellow decision‐makers of the superiority of one course of action over another. This model of the policymaking process is strongly supported by research studies, which suggest that at its heart lies unpredictability, ambiguity and the possibility of alternative interpretations of the ‘evidence’ [22–24].

The quest to make policymaking ‘fully evidence based’ may actually not be a desirable goal, as this benchmark arguably devalues democratic debate about the ethical and moral issues faced in policy choices. The 2005 UK Labour Party manifesto claimed that ‘what matters is what works’. But what matters, surely, is not just what ‘works’, but what is appropriate in the circumstances, and what is agreed by society to be the overall desirable goal. Deborah Stone, in her book Policy Paradox, argues that much of the policy process involves debates about values masquerading as debates about facts and data. In her words: ‘The essence of policymaking in political communities [is] the struggle over ideas. Ideas are at the centre of all political conflict … Each idea is an argument, or more accurately, a collection of arguments in favour of different ways of seeing the world’ [23].
---
# Criticisms of evidence-based healthcare

One of the most useful theoretical papers on the use of evidence in healthcare policymaking is by Dobrow and colleagues [24]. They distinguish the philosophical-normative orientation (that there is an objective reality to be discovered and that a piece of ‘evidence’ can be deemed ‘valid’ and ‘reliable’ independent of the context in which it is to be used) from the practical-operational orientation, in which evidence is defined in relation to a specific decision-making context, is never static and is characterized by emergence, ambiguity, and incompleteness.

From a practical-operational standpoint, research evidence is based on designs (such as randomized trials) that explicitly strip the study of contextual ‘contaminants’ and which therefore ignore the multiple, complex, and interacting determinants of health. It follows that a complex intervention that ‘works’ in one setting at one time will not necessarily ‘work’ in a different setting at a different time, and one that proves ‘cost-effective’ in one setting will not necessarily provide value for money in a different setting. Many of the arguments raised about EBHC in recent years have addressed precisely this controversy about the nature of knowledge.

Questioning the nature of evidence – and indeed, questioning evidential knowledge itself – is a somewhat scary place to end a basic introductory textbook on EBHC because most of the previous chapters in this book assume what Dobrow would call a philosophical-normative orientation. My own advice is this: if you are a humble student or clinician trying to pass your exams or do a better job at the bedside of individual patients, and if you feel thrown by the uncertainties I’ve raised in this final section, you can probably safely ignore them until you’re actively involved in policymaking yourself. But if your career is at the stage when you’re already sitting on decision-making bodies and trying to work out the answer to the question posed in the title to this section, I’d suggest you explore some of the papers and books referenced in this chapter. Do watch for the next generation of EBHC research, which increasingly addresses the fuzzier and more contestable aspects of this important topic.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Take a look at these papers arguing that evidence-based medicine/healthcare is ‘too simplistic’ [25], ‘too utilitarian’ [26], and ‘doesn’t answer the question about the individual patient’ [27].
2. Now look at this paper recently published by two of the founding fathers (sic) of evidence-based medicine [28], and this one, published by an epidemiologist scholar who likes to play devil’s advocate [29]. Both are arguing that the advantages of EBHC outweigh the downsides. To what extent do you think these writers have engaged with the philosophical criticisms of EBHC rather than simply reiterating its well-rehearsed strengths?

# Appendix 1 Checklists for finding, appraising and implementing evidence

Unless otherwise stated, these checklists can be applied to randomised controlled trials, other controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies or any other research evidence.

Is my practice evidence-based? - a context-sensitive checklist for individual clinical encounters (see Chapter 1)

|1.|Have I identified and prioritised the clinical, psychological, social and other problem(s), taking into account the patient’s perspective?|
|---|---|
|2.|Have I performed a sufficiently competent and complete examination to establish the likelihood of competing diagnoses?|
|3.|Have I considered additional problems and risk factors that may need opportunistic attention?|
|4.|Have I, where necessary, sought evidence (from systematic reviews, guidelines, clinical trials and other sources) pertaining to the problems?|
|5.|Have I assessed and taken into account the completeness, quality and strength of the evidence?|
|6.|Have I applied valid and relevant evidence to this particular set of problems in a way that is both scientifically justified and intuitively sensible?|
|7.|Have I presented the pros and cons of different options to the patient in a way he or she can understand, and incorporated the patient’s preferences into the final recommendation?|
|8.|Have I arranged review, recall, referral or other further care as necessary?|

# Appendix 1

# Checklist for searching (see Chapter 2)

1. Decide on the purpose of your search: browsing, seeking an answer to a clinical question or a comprehensive review (e.g. prior to undertaking a piece of research), and design your search strategy accordingly (see section ‘What are you looking for?’).

2. Go for the highest level of evidence you can (see section ‘Levels upon levels of evidence’). For example, high‐quality synthesised sources (e.g. systematic reviews and evidence‐based summaries and syntheses such as Clinical Evidence or NICE guidelines, see section ‘Synthesised sources: systems, summaries and syntheses’) represent a very high level of evidence.

3. For keeping abreast of new developments, use synopses such as POEMS (patient‐oriented evidence that matters), ACP Journal Club or Evidence‐based Medicine journal (see section ‘Pre‐appraised sources: synopses of systematic reviews and primary studies’).

4. Make yourself familiar with the specialised resources in your own field and use these routinely (see section ‘Specialised resources’).

5. When searching the Medline database for primary research, you will greatly increase the efficiency of your search if you do two broad searches and then combine them, or if you use tools such as the ‘limit set’ or ‘clinical queries’ function (see section ‘Primary studies – tackling the jungle’).

6. A very powerful way of identifying recent publications on a topic is to ‘citation chain’ an older paper (i.e. use a special electronic database to find which later papers have cited the older paper, see section ‘Primary studies – tackling the jungle’).

7. Federated search engines such as TRIP or SUMsearch search multiple resources simultaneously and are free (see section ‘One‐stop shopping: federated search engines’).

8. Human sources (expert librarians, experts in the field) are an important component of a thorough search (see section ‘Asking for help and asking around’).

9. To improve your skill and confidence in searching, try an online self‐study course (see section ‘Online tutorials for effective searching’).

- Was assessment of outcome (or, in a case–control study, allocation of caseness) ‘blind’?
5. Was the study large enough, and continued for long enough, and was follow‐up complete enough, to make the results credible?

Checklist for the statistical aspects of a paper (see Chapter 5)

1. Have the authors set the scene correctly?
- Have they determined whether their groups are comparable, and, if necessary, adjusted for baseline differences?
- What sort of data do they have, and have they used appropriate statistical tests?
- If the statistical tests in the paper are obscure, why have the authors chosen to use them?
- Have the data been analysed according to the original study protocol?
2. Paired data, tails and outliers
- Were paired tests performed on paired data?
- Was a two‐tailed test performed whenever the effect of an intervention could conceivably be a negative one?

4. Have the trials or reviews addressed a clearly focused, important and answerable clinical question that reflects a problem of relevance to patients? Do they provide evidence on safety, tolerability, efficacy and price?
5. Has each trial or meta-analysis defined the condition to be treated, the patients to be included, the interventions to be compared and the outcomes to be examined?
6. Does the material provide direct evidence that the drug will help my patients live a longer, healthier, more productive and symptom-free life?
7. If a surrogate outcome measure has been used, what is the evidence that it is reliable, reproducible, sensitive, specific, a true predictor of disease and rapidly reflects the response to therapy?
8. Do trial results indicate whether (and how) the effectiveness of the treatments differed and whether there was a difference in the type or frequency

|Outcome event|Total|
|---|---|
| |Yes|No|
|Control group|a|b|a + b|
|Experimental group|c|d|c + d|

If outcome event is undesirable (e.g. death)

CER = risk of undesirable outcome in control group = a/(a + b)

EER = risk of undesirable outcome in experimental group = c/(c + d)

Relative risk of undesirable event in experimental versus control group = EER/CER

Absolute risk reduction in treated group (ARR) = CER − EER

Number needed to treat (NNT) = 1/ARR = 1/(CER − EER)

If outcome event is desirable (e.g. cure)

CER = risk of desirable outcome in control group = a/(a + b)

EER = risk of desirable outcome in experimental group = c/(c + d)

Relative benefit increase in treated versus control group = EER/CER

Absolute benefit increase in treated versus control group = EER − CER

Number needed to treat (NNT) = 1/ARR = 1/(EER − CER)

# Introduction

R. Samuel Mayer

Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) is one of the broadest and most challenging specialties in medicine. Physiatrists see patients of all age groups with impairments of every organ system, and must have keen understanding of anatomy, biomechanics, ergonomics, exercise physiology, kinesiology, neurophysiology, pharmacology, and psychology. They not only prescribe medications and perform procedures, but also prescribe prosthetics, orthotics, splints, and complex medical equipment. They lead interdisciplinary teams that address the holistic bio-psycho-social and spiritual needs of people with disabling conditions. No wonder board certification preparation becomes a daunting task for examinees.

# ABOUT THE EXAM

In PM&R, board certification has three components: Part I is a written examination, testing medical knowledge; Part II is an oral examination that tests clinical practice skills. The third component is maintenance of certification (MOC), which is an ongoing educational and evaluation process after attainment of initial certification. Part I is taken in August after completion of residency training. Nine months later (in May), examinees can take Part II, after passing Part I and gaining some experience in clinical practice or fellowship. The final component is ongoing MOC, which promotes lifelong learning.

The Part I exam focuses on knowledge. The knowledge base for PM&R has enormous breadth and depth. However, the process of studying for a knowledge-based test should be familiar to most physicians. There are a host of textbooks, several board review books, and a number of question banks available to hone one’s familiarity with the field.

Part II, on the other hand, tests skills and behaviors. The Accreditation Committee for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) defined six core competencies for physicians: medical knowledge, clinical care, practice-based learning, communication, professionalism, and systems-based practice. Part I tests the first of these competencies, while Part II tests the remainder. How does one study for this?

I would first advise that “studying” is the wrong approach. One attains skills by doing, not by reading about them. It takes practice, practice, practice. You will learn most from your patients; listen to them carefully as their stories will enlighten you. Next, take advantage of your mentors’ skills and experience. Watch them examine patients, scoop up their pearls, and, above all, ask them questions and get their feedback.

The case scenarios in this book are those encountered every day at the bedside. In general, the cases used by the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (ABPMR) are not exotic or esoteric; they are meant to cover common problems encountered in general physiatric practice. The emphasis is on clinical practice, not trivial pursuit of obscure medical knowledge. You will not be asked to recite the medical literature, although it can help you to use clinical guidelines in your answers to demonstrate familiarity
---
# INTRODUCTION

With evidence-based medicine. Be specific but concise in your responses. Each examiner is given 40 minutes to review three to four cases with you. The cases are standardized. You do not need to complete all of the cases to pass. Often the last one or two cases that an examiner has to present are trial cases that the board is testing out for psychometric properties and not used in the actual scoring. You will have three examiners. The time schedule is rigid.

# HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

This workbook is an additional tool, unique in its format. It walks the reader through cases in an interactive format. While it can be used individually, many may choose to use it with a partner or in small groups, so that learners can give answers aloud, simulating the oral board exam.

The cases are structured in a similar format to the ABPMR Part II. The content mirrors the exam outline, which is available on the ABPMR website. Although none of the authors are current oral examiners (this would be a conflict of interest), all are board certified and highly experienced clinicians, many with national and international reputations for excellence in their subspecialties.

The exam consists of questions about case vignettes. Each vignette fits into one or more diagnostic categories (there are nine broad diagnostic categories), and each may focus on one or more evaluation or management skills. Each case tests five clinical skills: data acquisition, problem solving, patient management, system-based practice, and interpersonal communication and professionalism. Each vignette in this book also has questions about each of these clinical skills.

We have used icons to code the questions to correspond to these five clinical skills:

Data acquisition questions typically focus on pe history and physical exam.
Problem solving frequently deals wip diagnostic skills or biomechanics.
Patient management includes all aspects of treatment: medication, equipment, injections, rehabilitation perapies, and referrals to oper specialists, including surgery.
System-based practice refers to psychosocial and economic issues; quality improvement projects may also be discussed.
Communication skills will be evaluated by pe examiners. Be prepared to explain pings in lay terms as if you were talking to a patient.

# HINTS

Here are some hints for examinees. Dress and act professionally. Dress tends
to be more formal than most clinical workplaces. Men wear suits and ties;
women may also wear suits or conservative skirts and blouses. Treat these case
vignettes like real patients; picture the examiner as a patient in front of you. Ask
open-ended questions of the examiner; get additional detail on the patient’s
history and physical exam. Be empathetic and sensitive in your communication,
just as you would be with a real patient. Be cautious not to violate ethical stan-
dards like patient privacy and informed consent in your answers. Speak slowly
and articulate clearly. Use proper grammar. Do not be self-conscious if you have
an accent—we all have accents of some type. Although easier said than done,
be calm and natural, confident but not cocky.

While this text is intended as a board review workbook to be used in preparation
for the Part II exam, other audiences will find it helpful as well. All PM&R resi-
dents and fellows should have a copy—it is never too early to prepare for the
oral exam. Residency program directors and faculty will find these cases useful
in bedside and didactic instruction. Those preparing for MOC should also find
this useful. Practicing clinicians can use these vignettes to hone up on skills in
patient populations that they see less frequently.

# Amputee Care and Prosthetic Prescription

Heikki Uustal

# CASE 1: BELOW KNEE AMPUTATION: DYSVASCULAR

A 72-year-old male with diabetes, neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease presents with recent right below knee amputation (1 week ago) secondary to infection in the foot. Acute care physical therapy was able to mobilize the patient to wheelchair mobility and limited hopping 20 feet with a walker. His cardiovascular status is stable and the patient has only minimal pain, controlled with medications.

# Questions

1. The patient is asking about his functional potential with a prosthesis. What further information regarding his history or previous activity will help to predict his functional outcome?
2. As you examine the patient, what are the three most critical muscle groups in the lower limb and the upper limb to prepare for prosthetic ambulation?
3. As you examine the residual limb, there are several important aspects to assess and document. List at least four of these.
4. The patient is now going to subacute rehabilitation or home with home therapy. What are the essential components of the pre-prosthetic program to prepare for prosthetic fitting?
5. As part of the process of prescribing a prosthesis, the ordering physician must establish and document the patient’s “functional level” (also known as K-level) as defined by Medicare. The functional level will determine the category of prosthetic foot or knee allowed. Describe the functional levels.
6. Patient education and support during the pre-prosthetic and prosthetic phase are critical for patient understanding and participation. What issues in the psychosocial realm should be reviewed at each visit?

# AMPUTEE CARE AND PROSTHETIC PRESCRIPTION

# CASE 1: BELOW KNEE AMPUTATION: DYSVASCULAR

Answers

1. The patient’s functional mobility status prior to amputation and the length of time since he last walked a significant distance are the two important factors to determine his potential for future ambulation with a prosthesis.
2. Lower limb: Hip extensors, knee extensors, hip abductors. Grade 4/5 strength in these muscles is critical to get from sit to stand and maintain stability during ambulation. Upper limb: Elbow extensors, shoulder depressors (pectoralis, latissimus). Grade 4/5 strength in these muscles is necessary to allow a patient to support himself or herself with an assistive device and prevent falls.
3. Bone length, soft tissue coverage, skin integrity, healing status of the surgical site, sensation, tenderness to palpation, shape of the residual limb, and soft tissue mobility.
4. The goals of pre-prosthetic physical therapy/occupational therapy programs include strengthening of the critical muscles, prevention of contractures (hips and knees), improvement in cardiopulmonary endurance to meet the additional demands of prosthetic use, progress in mobility, desensitizing the limb, shrinking and shaping of the residual limb, education, and home exercise program.
5. K-levels are:
- 0 = nonambulatory
- 1 = transfers or limited household ambulatory
- 2 = household and limited community ambulatory
- 3 = unlimited community ambulatory
- 4 = high energy or activity beyond normal ambulation
6. Psychological adjustment to limb loss, evidence of depression, pain control, support/interaction with friends and family, and patient concerns about return to previous activity.

# AMPUTEE CARE AND PROSTHETIC PRESCRIPTION

# CASE 2: TRAUMATIC ABOVE KNEE AMPUTATION

A 32-year-old male with traumatic right transfemoral amputation presents 4 weeks after surgery for prosthetic prescription. His surgical site is well healed and he is ambulating with crutches indoors and outdoors for moderate distances. He has minimal residual limb or phantom limb pain.

# Questions

1. What further information would you like from the patient about his previous functional activity to assist with formulating the prosthetic prescription?
2. On examination, he has a long residual limb with a well-healed surgical site. He has a tapered shape and is non-tender to palpation. What level of strength and range of motion at the right hip are necessary to resume independent ambulation in the community without an assistive device?
3. The most critical feature of prosthetic fitting is socket design and comfort. This patient had a fairly sedentary work activity level, but enjoyed recreational sports regularly including golf, basketball, and swimming. As you write the prosthetic prescription, what type of socket design and suspension would you consider for a high activity level, younger amputee?
4. Prosthetic component selection is directed by the patient’s functional level and expected activities. What category of prosthetic knee and foot would be most appropriate?
5. Certain higher-level activities require special adaptations or special prosthetic devices. How will this patient resume driving and swimming?
6. Describe to the patient in lay terms how a hydraulic knee works.
7. As this same patient ages over many years, his functional status will also change. At what age should his prosthetic componentry be downgraded?

# CASE 2: TRAUMATIC ABOVE KNEE AMPUTATION

Answers

|1. Work activities:|How far does he need to walk? Are there stairs or uneven terrain? Does he do any lifting or carrying? Does he need to drive?|
|---|---|
| |Home activities:|Home set-up, stairs, family responsibilities/children?|
| |Social/recreational activities:|Sports, fitness, exercise|
|2.|Grade 4/5 strength at right hip extension and abduction is necessary to maintain trunk stability in single limb stance during ambulation (without an assistive device). Hip extension to 20° to 30° is necessary to achieve reciprocal gait with near normal gait parameters.|
|3.|Contemporary sockets for transfemoral amputation should include a narrow mediolateral, ischial containment socket using a rigid outer frame and flexible inner socket. True suction suspension with no soft interface (skin against inner plastic socket) may give the most intimate fit and best feedback to the patient, but is very dependent on stable residual limb volume. Suction suspension using a gel liner with a strap, pin, or seal will also provide excellent suspension, and is less dependent on a stable limb volume. Semi-suction with socks and a belt provides the least effective suspension.|
|4.|To achieve variable cadence (slow and fast walk, run), swing and stance phase control, and good stability on uneven terrain, this patient should have a hydraulic knee or microprocessor hydraulic knee. He will require a dynamic response foot (carbon fiber) to provide effective propulsion during fast walk and higher-level activities. He may also need a shock/torque absorber for high level activities with impact.|
|5.|Return to driving after right lower limb loss requires installation of a left side gas pedal in the car and proper driver training to resume safe and legal driving. Return to swimming in a pool is best accomplished with no prosthesis in the water. Even a waterproof prosthesis does not improve swimming in a pool. However, wading into the ocean or a lake requires 2 feet on the ground; therefore, a waterproof prosthesis would be necessary in these cases.|
|6.|A hydraulic knee has a piston, containing fluid, which controls the motion of the knee. This piston allows for variable speeds of gait, making it useful for uneven surfaces or quick changes in position.|
|7.|Age should have little or no impact on the decision-making process for prosthetic componentry. If the patient continues to prove to be a successful prosthetic user for higher-level activities, then you should continue to prescribe the appropriate devices. The components should match the activity, not the age.|

# AMPUTEE CARE AND PROSTHETIC PRESCRIPTION

# CASE 3: UPPER LIMB AMPUTATION

A 34-year-old carpenter severed his right forearm below the elbow in a work injury 3 weeks ago. He is referred to your prosthetic clinic by his trauma surgeon.

# Questions

1. What further questions do you have about his history that would help you prescribe a prosthesis for him? What are important key elements in the physical exam?
2. The limb was severed by a motorized saw. His pain is reasonably well controlled with oxycodone and naproxen. He has phantom sensations but no phantom pain. He is right hand dominant. He has no significant past medical history. He wants to eventually return to work as a carpenter. He enjoys hunting, fishing, and canoeing. Workers compensation is paying for his medical care and rehabilitation after this injury. His incision is well healed and sutures have been removed. The amputation is at 5 cm from the olecranon process. There is no point tenderness. Elbow flexion and extension strength are 4/5. He has approximately 45° of pronation and supination. What diagnostic tests are indicated at this time?
3. What are the major considerations in prescribing a prosthesis for this man?
4. What are the key components of a below elbow (transradial) prosthesis? What special adaptations would help make the prosthesis more functional for him?
5. His workers compensation insurance case manager comes to the appointment with the patient. She requests to be present in the exam room during your evaluation. How should you handle this?
6. How does workers compensation insurance coverage differ from medical insurance coverage in terms of the prosthesis?

# AMPUTEE CARE AND PROSTHETIC PRESCRIPTION

# CASE 3: UPPER LIMB AMPUTATION

Answers
1. What are his vocational and recreational goals? How is his pain, and does he have phantom pain? Hand dominance? Comorbidities? On physical exam, how is pe incision healing? What is pe lengp of pe residual limb? How is his elbow range and strengp?
2. No diagnostic tests are necessary now. If he had point tenderness or palpable masses in pe residual limb, a forearm x-ray to look for bony fragments or foreign objects could be considered.
3. He wishes to return to manual labor and oupoor sportsmen activities. A manually powered prospesis may be more durable and reliable for pese conditions. His residual limb is short, and pat will require some adaptation to pe suspension (likely a harness). Because he has limited supination and pronation, his prospetic wrist will require pese elements.
4. The prospetic hand can be myo-electrically or body powered. The latter may be more practical for him if he intends to use it in wet conditions or for heavier activities. Body-powered terminal devices can be voluntary opening or voluntary closing devices. Voluntary opening devices are easier to use, particularly for prolonged grasp, but voluntary closing devices can apply more force or be used for finer movements. The prospetic wrist can have friction activated supination and pronation, which rotate to supination during heavier lifting. Because his limb is short, he will likely need a harness suspension, as self-suspension wip a supracondylar sleeve may not hold his prospesis in place adequately (Figures 1.1, 1.2).
5. The patient should be asked if he is comfortable wip pis and informed he has pe right to refuse. In most states, pe workers compensation insurance does, however, have pe right to review pe medical records if pey are paying pe bills.
6. Workers compensation is required to provide any care or equipment needed for return to work. Medical insurance only needs to cover what is termed “medically necessary.” Many insurance companies interpret pis as pe most basic prospesis to return pe patient to basic self-care functioning.

# CASE 1: HYPOXIC BRAIN INJURY

A 22-year-old female suffered respiratory and circulatory arrest secondary to status asthmaticus. She was resuscitated by emergency medical service and subsequently hospitalized for 4 weeks with multiple complications including ventilator-dependent respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement. After being weaned from the ventilator it is apparent that she has severe neurologic impairment. You are asked to see her to determine if she is a candidate for inpatient brain injury rehabilitation.

# Questions

1. What are the key elements of the history?
2. The patient is awake and breathing spontaneously on humidified oxygen via tracheostomy collar. Vital signs are normal. What are the important features of the physical exam?
3. She is able to track the examiner and follow some simple commands but her responses are slow. She is not vocalizing due to the tracheostomy tube but is able to mouth some words. What are your recommendations at this point?
4. In patients with severely impaired consciousness after cardiopulmonary resuscitation, what are the key negative prognostic indicators?
5. Several months later, you see the patient for an outpatient visit. She was discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and then completed a course of outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. She is able to walk without assistance and is performing basic activities of daily living on her own, but her family is still providing 24-hour supervision and they manage her appointments and finances. They note that sometimes they still need to cue her for safety or to complete a task. She would like to go back to school and resume driving. What are your recommendations at this point?
6. The parents are seeking legal guardianship for the patient. They bring in a form from their attorney, which asks whether the patient has capacity. How might you determine this?

CASE 1: HYPOXIC BRAIN INJURY

Answers
1. In patients wip hypoxic brain injury (HBI), a complete history includes a detailed hospital course, injury mechanism, duration of hypoxia/ischemia, duration of disordered consciousness and pospypoxic amnesia, residual impairments, and medical comorbidities pus far. In terms of pre-morbid history, it is important to obtain prior functional status (including vocational history and driving), level of education, previous history of drug or alcohol abuse, previous psychiatric history and premorbid personality, as well as social support.
2. Arousal, visual tracking, response to tactile or painful stimulation, ability to follow verbal commands, ability to accurately indicate yes/no responses, passive and active range of motion in pe limbs to evaluate for spasticity, contracture, or heterotopic ossification. In patients who can participate furper pe following should also be assessed: cerebellar and fine motor testing, coordination, visual testing (including testing for agnosia), orientation, attention, processing speed, memory, judgment, insight, affect, and behavior.
3. Initiate a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program to promote physical and cognitive recovery. This should include attention to sleep-wake cycle, management of any agitation, tracheostomy tube weaning, management of any pospypoxic seizures or movement disorders, spasticity management and serial examinations to exclude new papology, or improvement to guide pe rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation nursing involvement is important to care for skin and for bowel and bladder management as well as to help maintain pe perapeutic milieu and advance team goals. Physical perapy is important for functional mobility and may address spasticity or dyskinesias as well. Occupational perapy may introduce adaptive strategies for visual and cognitive deficits as well as self-care skills. Speech/language papology will need to work on diet advancement as well as cognitive-linguistic deficits. A neuropsychologist can help to guide pe team’s efforts and provide counseling and education to pe patient and family. Social work is important to coordinate transitions of care, identify resources, and keep families informed of pe expected course as pe patient progresses prough pe rehabilitation process.
4. In patients wip absent pupillary or corneal reflexes, or absent extensor motor responses 3 days after cardiac arrest, pe outcome is invariably poor (Level A, strong evidence). A poor prognosis is also conferred if pere is myoclonic status epilepticus wipin pe first day (Level B, good evidence), bilaterally absent N20 response by day 3, or serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels >33 mcg/L at days 1 to 3 (Level B, good evidence). Prognosis cannot be based on circumstances of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, elevated temperature, EEG, intracranial pressure, or neuroimaging studies.
5. Management of chronic hypoxic brain injury involves gradual reintegration into pe community wip ongoing education and support as well as appropriate

Referrals to community-based services. This may include neuropsychological evaluation and counseling or follow up, vocational rehabilitation services, and driving evaluation if the patient is able. It is important to note that any post-hypoxic seizures may affect restoration of driving privileges. You should continue to follow up to monitor for secondary conditions such as depression or other mood disturbances.

Capacity means that the patient has adequate intellectual abilities to describe his or her medical situation, appraise alternatives, and make rational choices based on values. You might ask the patient to describe his or her diagnosis and treatment. You might ask what would happen if the patient did not take prescribed medications or follow through with therapies. A patient does not need to have normal intellectual function in order to have capacity.

# CASE 2: SEVERE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

A 21-year-old male is being admitted to acute rehabilitation after being treated
in acute care for a traumatic brain injury and several rib fractures due to a motor
vehicle crash. The patient does not have any past medical history.

# Questions

1. What key elements would you want to know from the history of this injury? What information would you like to have from pre-injury history?
2. The records indicate that the injury occurred in a high-speed motor vehicle crash and that your patient was the driver. His initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6 and his trauma workup revealed bifrontal contusions and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as multiple rib fractures. He was intubated and sedated and had an intracranial pressure monitor placed. One week later he was extubated and transferred to a step-down floor where he had some intermittent fevers and tachycardia without an infectious source. It is now 3 weeks post-injury and he remains nonverbal. What is important to look for on physical exam?
3. The patient is awake and appears alert. He visually tracks the examiner and pushes the examiner away with painful stimulation. His psychomotor activity is slightly increased. He does not follow any verbal commands or indicate a yes/no response. What is the level of severity of this patient’s traumatic brain injury? What are some important prognostic indicators in a patient such as this? What assessment instruments would be helpful in forecasting this patient’s recovery?
4. The patient transitions to your acute rehabilitation unit. What pharmacologic interventions would you consider to improve recovery?
5. Over the next few months the patient completes inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation. He recovers basic language skills and is able to ambulate; however, he has significant residual cognitive deficits and requires partial supervision from family. He is interested in returning to work and driving. How can you help him? What are some good predictors of success?
6. The patient does poorly with his driver evaluation, and is distraught over the results. How can you counsel him regarding avoidance of driving?

# CASE 2: SEVERE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

Answers
1. Certain elements of pe injury’s history will help to determine injury severity as well as pe pattern of deficits pat would be expected and pe prognosis for a good recovery. These would be injury mechanism, loss of consciousness and duration, residual impairments (especially posttraumatic amnesia), initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, associated injuries, and postinjury complications pus far. Certain elements of pe pre-injury history are useful in pe course of recovery. These would be prior functional status (including vocational history and driving), level of education, previous history of drug or alcohol abuse, previous psychiatric history, previous history of traumatic brain injury, social supports, and premorbid personality.
2. Important elements of a physical exam in such a case are: arousal, visual tracking, response to tactile or painful stimulation, ability to follow verbal commands, ability to accurately indicate yes/no responses, orientation if possible, passive and active range of motion in pe limbs as best as can possibly be assessed if pe patient cannot follow commands, as well as tone.
3. This patient has a severe traumatic brain injury. Since his level of consciousness seems to be impaired, pe Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) can be used to predict recovery. As he emerges, pe Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) or pe Orientation-log (O-log) can be used to assess posttraumatic amnesia (PTA). A patient is considered emerged from PTA wip a score >75 on pe GOAT or >25 on pe O-log for 2 consecutive days. Early predictors of recovery are time to follow commands (also defined as lengp of coma), duration of PTA, and age. Individuals greater pan 65 years old are not likely to have a “good” recovery, meaning little to no disability.
4. Before adding any pharmacologic agents to improve recovery, pe list of active medications should be reviewed and any medications pat potentially impair cognition should be discontinued or weaned. This may include opiates, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and medications wip anticholinergic activity. If pe patient is on anticonvulsants, pe need to continue pem should be evaluated. For patients wip posttraumatic disorders of consciousness, amantadine has been demonstrated to accelerate pe pace of functional recovery.
5. Now pat pe patient has made a good physical recovery and has been discharged from outpatient perapies it is time to refer him to home- and community-based rehabilitation services pat can eventually include vocational rehabilitation and an assessment by a certified driving rehabilitation specialist to determine his readiness to resume driving. Patients who have supportive families or significant opers are more likely to succeed and so involving pem is very important.

6. Be empathetic and acknowledge his frustration. Driving puts him at risk of injuring not only himself but others. In many states, you as a physician may be obligated to report him to the motor vehicle administration. You should engage his family for help in enforcing this restriction, as well as in counseling him about the risks.

# CASE 3: ACUTE CONCUSSION

A 17-year-old high school student is seen in the clinic 3 days after being removed from a football game by the athletic trainer due to a suspected concussion. He reports having had no prior concussions.

# Questions

1. What history and physical findings are important in determining whether he has had a significant concussion?
2. You learn that he had some momentary loss of consciousness and disorientation on the field. Today he still has a headache, and reports difficulty concentrating in class. His Mini-Mental Status Exam is 28/30. He was admitted to a hospital overnight after sustaining a traumatic brain injury with 10-minute loss of consciousness from a fall when he was 10 years old. What information may lead you to conclude that this player may be at risk for a prolonged recovery time?
3. How should you proceed regarding clearance for return to play?
4. His mother asks about whether his prior traumatic brain injury puts him at increased risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). How do you respond?
5. The following day, the boy’s football coach calls. He wants him to play in next week’s homecoming game, as the patient is the star quarterback. How should you respond?
6. The patient has a major exam next week, and he is worried about his performance. What can be done to help him with this issue?

# 2: BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

# CASE 3: ACUTE CONCUSSION

Answers
1. One should determine if pere was any loss of consciousness, alpough one can have a concussion wipout pis. Amnesia, altered level of alertness, behavioral changes, fatigue, nausea, headache, and balance problems are all common symptoms. Ideally, pe aplete should be examined immediately on pe field for changes in orientation, alertness, cranial nerve findings, and balance, coordination, and motor deficits. However, high schools frequently do not have pe resources to do pis, so it should be done in pe office when seen by pe physician. A Mini-Mental Status Exam should be performed. One should ask about any prior history of head injuries.
2. Certain findings are predictive of higher risk for delayed recovery time: visual memory and processing speed problems, migraine headaches, complaints of “fogginess,” and multiple prior concussions.
3. Return to play should follow a stepwise protocol. Do not initiate activity until pe aplete is asymptomatic at rest. Then, increase level of intensity in non-contact activity (light exercise, moderate exercise, pen heavy exercise, pen contact in practice, finally full clearance for game play). If pe aplete develops symptoms at any level, return to pe prior asymptomatic activity level and proceed as tolerated. The aplete should have returned to pe prior level of neurocognitive function prior to return to play as well.
4. The prior traumatic brain injury is only one of pe multiple factors pat may lead to chronic traumatic encephalopapy (CTE). CTE may be related to pe cumulative number of subconcussive blows pat an aplete receives, pe number of concussions, genetic factors, and environmental factors.
5. Because of HIPAA laws, you cannot speak to pe coach wipout written consent from pe patient and his parent(s). If pey do provide consent, you should emphasize pat your professional duty is to pe patient’s healp, and pat you will not change your recommendations based on pe needs of pe team.
6. You can talk to pe school and see if pey are willing to eiper postpone pe exam or perhaps allow pe patient more time to complete pe exam. Usually to qualify for accommodations under pe law, a student would need to have a certified disability and an individualized education plan in place. These are not usually done for a temporary disability. However, pe teacher or principal may be willing to accommodate under pese circumstances.

# CASE 4: POSTCONCUSSIVE SYNDROME

A 40-year-old female is referred to you by her attorney for lingering symptoms related to a motor vehicle crash 6 months prior.

# Questions

1. What details of the accident are helpful in determining the severity of her injury?
2. She had no loss of consciousness and took herself to the emergency department, where she had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and an unremarkable head CT. What pre-injury risk factors may have contributed to this slow recovery despite lack of severity of findings on initial presentation?
3. She reports that she has had persistent headaches. What approach should be taken to assess and manage posttraumatic headaches?
4. Dizziness is a prominent symptom with accompanying balance problems. What are the common reasons for these symptoms after mild TBI and how do they present?
5. Discuss the role of posttraumatic psychosocial factors in delaying recovery.
6. Her attorney asks if this is a case of postconcussive syndrome. How do you respond?

# BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

# CASE 4: POSTCONCUSSIVE SYNDROME

# Answers

1. Important details from the acute injury are any loss of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and radiographic results (CT scan?).
2. Personality characteristics, mental health problems, substance abuse, prior brain injuries, and prior medical/neurologic problems are all important factors in predisposing the patient to chronic postconcussive symptoms.
3. Assess prior history of headaches. Categorize the headache. Determine interventions based on headache type. Migrainous headaches are most common, followed by tension-type headaches. Occipital neuralgia is also common. Migraines are episodic, often have auras or visual changes, and are described as throbbing or pounding. Tension headaches are more constant, and frequently originate from the neck or occiput. With occipital neuralgia, there is a Tinel’s sign over the greater or lesser occipital nerves, reproducing symptoms.
4. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is demonstrated with rapid changes in position, and, specifically, by performing the Dix-Halpike maneuver. Posttraumatic perilymphatic fistula may present with vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, nausea, and postexertional headache. Posttraumatic endolymphatic hydrops is associated with ipsilateral low frequency hearing loss and a sensation of ear fullness.
5. Physical, emotional, cognitive, vocational, financial, and recreational factors may all play a role in delaying recovery. They may lead to maladaptive health-related beliefs that may be difficult to treat.
6. You should explain your findings in lay terms. To meet the criteria for postconcussive syndrome the patient must have a history of head trauma, and findings in at least three of six areas: (a) headache, dizziness, fatigue, noise intolerance; (b) emotional changes; (c) subjective cognitive complaints; (d) insomnia; (e) reduced alcohol tolerance; and (f) preoccupation with symptoms, fear of permanent brain damage, or adoption of the sick role.

CASE 5: BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT

A 23-year-old male is admitted to the inpatient brain injury rehabilitation unit after sustaining a traumatic brain injury due to a high-speed motor vehicle crash 2 weeks ago. He is awake and alert but confused and disoriented. He is uncooperative with treatments and at times aggressive.

# Questions

1. What more do you need to know about his history in regard to these behavioral problems?
2. He had no premorbid history of behavioral problems. He had bilateral frontotemporal intracerebral hemorrhages on his CT at the time of his injury. He has no relevant comorbidities. What nonpharmacologic approaches may help decrease his agitation?
3. What classes of medications could be considered to control his behavior and what side effects should be considered for each class?
4. To determine whether your interventions are effective, what validated outcome measures can be used?
5. A nursing assistant comes to you extremely angry. She says the patient became sexually aggressive with her, exposing himself and using profane language. She no longer wants to care for the patient. How can you help defuse the situation?
6. A nurse comes to you reporting the patient is punching staff members, and wants an order for hand restraints. What policies must you keep in mind before ordering restraints?
---
# 2: BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

# CASE 5: BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT

Answers
1. One would want to know if he had any premorbid behavioral issues or psychiatric disorders. The location of his brain injury is also important; agitation is most frequently associated wip orbito-frontal injuries. These commonly occur in acceleration/deceleration mechanism of injury (e.g., high-speed motor vehicle crashes) due to pe rough undersurface of pe skull in pis region. The nursing and perapy staff should be interviewed to determine triggers for pe behavior, as well as its severity. Is pe patient at risk for harming himself or opers? One must assess for comorbidities such as infections, metabolic disorders, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, sleep deficits, or seizures pat may contribute.
2. Avoid overstimulation (e.g., crowded rooms, or television), provide day/night cues, orientation cues, and quiet at night. Having a family member stay wip him can be helpful. If he is at risk of falling, a sitter may reduce pat risk, as can video surveillance, if available. Restraints should be avoided, as pese can bop increase agitation and also be risk factors for more serious injury. Minimize invasive devices such as IVs or Foley capeters as much as possible.
3. Medications should be used only when conservative measures are failing and pe patient is at risk of injuring himself or opers. Some medications and possible side effects include antipsychotics (sedation, slowing of motor recovery, QT interval prolongation, epileptogenic), beta-blockers (hypotension, sedation), antiseizure medications (hepatotoxicity, sedation), lipium (renal problems), and serotonergic medications (electrolyte abnormalities, serotonin syndrome, and priapism).
4. Agitated Behavioral Scale (ABS), Overt Agitation Severity Scale (OASS), or Overt Behaviour Scale (OBS).
5. Staff on a brain injury unit should be trained about common behavioral problems in pis population and have basic understanding of pe physiology behind pese issues. Sexually aggressive behavior should be treated by establishing firm limits, wipout escalating emotional responses. The psychologist may help develop cognitive behavioral approaches including appropriate rewards and punishments to suppress pese behaviors.
6. Physical restraints should be used only as a last resort if pe patient is a risk to self or opers. Most regulatory bodies (Joint Commission or Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) require clear hospital policies pat address when restraints can be used, duration of use, frequent reassessment of pe necessity of restraints (usually at least daily), and documentation of why alternatives could not be used.

# 2: BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS - CASE 6: OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT

A 45-year-old college professor fell down a flight of stairs when leaving the lecture hall and sustained a traumatic brain injury. He was admitted to a hospital and was discharged after 2 days. He was referred to be seen in the PM&R clinic 2 weeks later.

# Questions

1. What questions should you ask him to determine if he is having ongoing disability from this injury? What exam should be done?
2. He notes that he has difficulty concentrating and staying on task, and is easily distracted. He denies vertigo, balance or coordination problems, and has no headache or visual symptoms. His Mini-Mental Status Exam score is 28/30. What concurrent problems associated with his brain injury may be leading to or exacerbating these complaints?
3. Explain the effects of concussion to him.
4. He has heard that comprehensive neuropsychological testing is the definitive way to diagnose cognitive deficits and asks whether you will order this soon. How do you respond to this assertion and the question regarding timing?
5. He has taken the remainder of the semester off work. Two months after his injury, he is continuing to demonstrate deficits in arousal, attention, and processing speed. What class of medications may be most appropriate to help address this problem, and what are their potential side effects?
6. How could you determine his readiness to return to work? What resources might be available to assist in this process?

# BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

# CASE 6: OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT

Answers
1. One should ask about difficulties wip memory, attention, emotional lability, mood, headaches, vision, balance, and coordination. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are simple cognitive screening tools. A standard neurologic exam including cranial nerves, finger-nose-finger, and gait evaluation should be performed.
2. Poor sleep, medications, headaches, visual problems, anxiety, and depression can contribute to cognitive dysfunction.
3. Because he is a professor, your language can be at a higher level, but you still need to avoid medical jargon. Concussion is a “bruising” of pe brain. You do not necessarily need loss of consciousness to have a concussion. Effects may last from a few days to permanent damage depending on pe severity. Patients often have headaches, visual problems, cognitive difficulties, mood disturbance, insomnia, or excessive sleepiness.
4. Neuropsychological testing is pe most sensitive measure of cognitive function. That is not to say pat it can definitively diagnose a concussion, alpough patterns of deficits identified may help suggest consistency wip traumatic brain injury. If it is important early on to determine wheper pe patient has subtle deficits pat might be clinically important and not easily detectable by oper means, early neuropsychological testing may be indicated. It should also be noted pat some elements of neuropsychological tests may not be able to be repeated for several monps, so if a re-evaluation is needed, it may need to be delayed.
5. The class of medications pat may be most beneficial are stimulant medications. Potential side effects include anxiety/nervousness, decreased appetite, and elevations in heart rate and blood pressure.
6. One needs to know pe details of his job duties. Is he giving lectures, teaching small groups, doing research, writing, or doing administrative work? In addition to cognitive testing, more functionally based tests may be useful to evaluate specific work-related tasks. These may be performed by occupational perapy or a speech language papologist. If pe injury is work-related, benefits will also be available prough workers compensation. A case manager may be able to get him vocational counseling and also work wip his employer on reasonable accommodations.

CASE 7: COMPLICATIONS OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

A 48-year-old man who suffered a gunshot wound to the head is in your acute inpatient rehabilitation unit. He had a right-sided decompressive craniectomy 8 weeks ago and has left hemiparesis. A nurse informs you he is more lethargic than usual this morning with difficulty waking up. At baseline he is alert, responsive, and appropriate.

# Questions

1. What specific information do you want to know about his course overnight?
2. You learn that he slept well, no medication changes were made, and he was afebrile with stable vitals. You go to examine the patient. What is critical to do on physical exam?
3. You find that he is answering questions but is lethargic and slow to respond. His craniectomy site appears slightly more tense and bulging than you remembered. What is your differential diagnosis?
4. What workup would you order?
5. His seizure, metabolic, and infectious workup is negative. CT of the head shows a hydrocephalus and he is sent for shunt placement. What are the types of hydrocephalus and which is more common in traumatic brain injury? What are possible complications that can arise related to a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt?
6. Explain to his wife what hydrocephalus is in lay terms.
7. How might you go about establishing guidelines on your brain injury unit for monitoring patients for hydrocephalus?
---
# BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

# CASE 7: COMPLICATIONS OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

Answers
1. You should ask about any recent medication changes or missed doses. His sleep-wake cycle should be explored. Has he had any symptoms of infection such as cough or dysuria?
2. Begin wip checking vital signs and his level of arousal/responsiveness. Examine pe craniectomy site for subgaleal effusion or incisional erypema. Test pupillary reactions and eye movements, strengp, sensation, and muscle tone. Observe for signs of shaking/seizures.
3. Differential diagnosis includes metabolic/electrolyte disturbance, rebleeding/intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, seizure, central nervous system infection (abscess or meningitis), and urinary tract infection.
4. Labs and tests would include basic metabolic panel (BMP), CBC wip differential, urinalysis, CT head, and EEG.
5. Types of hydrocephalus are communicating versus noncommunicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus. Communicating hydrocephalus is more common. Potential complications of VP shunts are infection, undershunting (or shunt failure), overshunting (which can cause intracranial hemorrhage), headache, and seizures.
6. You should explain in lay terms pat hydrocephalus (Figure 2.1) is excess fluid in pe brain, caused by obstruction of flow. The effects of hydrocephalus on cognition, gait, and continence should be explained.
7. Do a plan, do, see, act (PDSA) cycle. Perform a literature review for identifying subpopulations at risk for developing hydrocephalus (plan). Educate staff about signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus (do). See how many hydrocephalus cases are identified in your unit over a quarter, and wheper pey were found early (see). Then determine if furper interventions, such as order sets, are needed (act).

# CASE 8: PARKINSON’S DISEASE

A 65-year-old woman is seen in your clinic. She has a family history of idiopathic
Parkinson’s disease and she is concerned that she is developing symptoms.

# Questions

1. What elements of history and physical exam are critical in making a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease?
2. What is the differential diagnosis for Parkinson’s disease?
3. Your patient has early signs of Parkinson’s disease on exam and may be a candidate for pharmacologic therapy. Are there any medications that can alter the course of the disease?
4. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. What is the role of rehabilitation?
5. What are the surgical treatments for advanced Parkinson’s disease?
6. Her mother died after a prolonged course of Parkinson’s disease. She would like to be assured that if/when her mental condition deteriorates, she does not go through what her mother did. What advice do you have?
7. What home modifications should she consider?

# BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

# CASE 8: PARKINSON’S DISEASE

Answers
1. Signs and symptoms include resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, masked facies, festinating gait, postural instability, freezing episodes, cognitive changes, orpostasis, micrographia, and low voice volume.
2. Exposure to medications including neuroleptics, metoclopramide, lipium, and amiodarone can cause pese symptoms. Complications of traumatic brain injuries, stroke, brain tumor, and metabolic encephalopapy can also mimic Parkinson’s disease.
3. There is no conclusive evidence to support pe use of any medications to significantly alter pe course of pe disease. However, symptoms can be controlled wip dopaminergic agents. Levodopa/carbidopa is a combination medication commonly prescribed for Parkinson’s disease. Levodopa raises dopamine levels by serving as pe metabolic precursor to dopamine. Carbidopa prevents systemic metabolism of levodopa.
4. Rehabilitation can be effective in pe short term in improving gait, activities of daily living, speech quality, cognition, providing adaptive equipment, and improving home safety. Gains made in rehabilitation are lost over time so patients should be sent to physical, occupational, and speech perapy every 6 to 12 monps.
5. There are two broad categories of neurosurgical procedures used currently. Destructive surgery includes palamotomy or pallidotomy. Deep brain stimulation using electrodes implanted in pe substantia nigra can help wip tremor.
6. She should write a living will or prepare advance directives. She should identify a person to be her durable power of attorney should she become mentally incapacitated, and make sure pat person knows her wishes not only about resuscitation, but also mechanical ventilation, enteral nutrition, life-prolonging medications, dialysis, and rehospitalizations.
7. If possible, she should live in a one-story home. She should minimize obstructions. Area rugs should be taped down. Her baproom should have grab bars or a 3-in-1 commode. She should have night lights.

# CASE 9: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

A 27-year-old woman has had multiple sclerosis (MS) for 5 years. She is finding it more difficult to walk recently over the summer. She is on a beta-interferon but takes no other medications. Her last acute flare was 2 years ago. Vitals are normal.

# Questions

1. What key elements do you want to know from her history? What complications of MS do you need to ask about in your review of systems?
2. She tells you that this has been a gradual insidious worsening, mainly due to stiffness in her legs. She also fatigues easily. She has had some urinary incontinence recently. What is critical to do on physical exam?
3. Mental status, cranial nerves, sensation, and coordination are intact. Strength is 5/5, but she has modified Ashworth scale 2 tone in her lower limbs, especially adductors, ankle plantar flexion, and inversion. She has three beats of clonus in both ankles. Her gait is a spastic diplegic pattern. Range of motion at hips, knees, and ankles is full. Skin is intact. What is the differential diagnosis of her difficulty walking? What diagnostic testing, if any, is indicated?
4. MRI shows plaques in the thoracic cord and periventricular white matter, which are unchanged from 2 years ago. Urinalysis is normal. What interventions would help her gait?
5. She works as an elementary school teacher, but is finding it difficult to continue working. She wants to apply for Social Security. What advice would you give her regarding applying for this?
6. You recommend an ankle foot orthosis, but the patient is reluctant to use this because of cosmesis. How would you try to convince her to use this device?
---
# BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

# CASE 9: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

Answers
1. The course of her MS is critical to assess (relapse or insidious progression?). Review of symptoms should include: vision changes, tremor, fatigue, heat sensitivity, weakness in limbs, spasms, and bladder changes.
2. Physical exam includes cranial nerves, sensation, coordination, strengp, muscle tone, reflexes, range of motion, and gait analysis.
3. Differential diagnosis: flare, secondary progressive disease, “pseudo-flare” from infection or oper stressor, heat sensitivity, ataxia, spasticity. Tests: MRI, urinalysis.
4. Treatment includes physical perapy for gait training and stretching, maintaining cool environment, orpotics prescription, spasticity management, and dalfampridine (Ampyra). Corticosteroids or ACTH and plasmapheresis are not indicated as pis is secondary progressive MS and not a flare.
5. Social Security requires documentation of total and permanent disability (inability to perform any kind of work for which she’s educationally qualified). Discuss reasonable accommodation under pe Americans wip Disability Act (e.g., air conditioning, teaching while seated, teacher’s aide, first floor classroom).
6. Be empapetic and acknowledge her concerns. You can discuss how an AFO can give one a more normal gait pattern, decrease risk of falling, and decrease energy of gait. You should also discuss how a molded AFO can be hidden by slacks.

# CASE 1: HEAD AND NECK CANCER

A 70-year-old man presents to your cancer rehabilitation program with recently diagnosed laryngeal cancer. He is starting chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and will undergo laryngectomy and radical neck dissection in 3 weeks.

# Questions

1. What additional history would you like to know? What should you focus on with your physical exam?
2. He has some hoarseness but is otherwise asymptomatic. He has mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and uses an inhaler infrequently. He quit smoking 2 years ago. What should the focus of his rehabilitation be at this time?
3. He returns to your clinic postoperatively. He has had a right radical neck dissection and laryngectomy. He is aphonic. He reports neck and right shoulder pain. What is the differential diagnosis for these complaints, and what physical exam findings and diagnostic tests would help establish a diagnosis?
4. He has right inferolateral scapular winging with shoulder shrug. EMG shows positive sharp waves and large amplitude MUPs with decreased recruitment in the trapezius. What is the diagnosis and how would you treat this condition?
5. He undergoes video-fluoroscopy swallow evaluation, which demonstrates aspiration of all consistencies of liquids and solids. The speech therapist recommends that he be NPO, and should have a percutaneous endoscopically placed gastrostomy (PEG) tube. He refuses, saying food is his only joy. How should you respond?
6. You are interested in seeing more patients like this and expanding your head and neck cancer rehabilitation program. How would you go about this?

# CANCER AND OTHER MEDICALLY RELATED IMPAIRMENTS

# CASE 1: HEAD AND NECK CANCER

|Answers|
|---|
|1. You would want to know his goals.|He wants to enjoy his retirement, especially holidays with his grandchildren. What are his current symptoms? You ask about comorbidities. You ask if he has any side effects from his chemotherapy, especially numbness. You would want to examine his neck for lymphadenopathy and range of motion. A careful neurologic exam should include a thorough examination for cranial nerve and sensory deficits.|
|2. At this phase of his disease, he should engage in a “prehabilitation” program focusing on prevention of common complications. This would include swallowing exercises, strengthening, and promoting range of motion of the neck.|
|3. The differential diagnosis includes fibrosis of neck muscles from surgical scarring or radiation fibrosis, spinal accessory palsy, lymphedema, or brachial plexopathy. Physical exam should include range of motion, palpation for lymphedema, and observation of scapular motion during shoulder flexion and shrugging. Electrodiagnostic testing will be useful.|
|4. The likely diagnosis is spinal accessory nerve palsy. Physical therapy, including taping, and neuromuscular stimulation may help. Gabapentin, pregabalin, and/or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor may help with neuropathic pain.|
|5. One should be empathetic and listen to his concerns. He is an adult and has every right to refuse the procedure. After listening, remind him that his 5-year survival with laryngeal cancer is over 50%, and that nutrition is critical to his quality of life. The enteral feedings may well be temporary until he regains strength in his pharyngeal muscles. Express your concern regarding his ability to maintain his nutrition without getting pneumonia. He can then make an informed decision.|
|6. Marketing the program should be targeted at the treating physicians: the otolaryngologists and medical and radiation oncologists. In addition, nurse navigators, nurse practitioners, and/or physician assistants often are the primary referring providers for these services. Attending tumor boards or cancer committee meetings help reinforce these connections.|

# CASE 2: BREAST CANCER

A 60-year-old woman sees you for the first time and reports that 1 year ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a right mastectomy with a sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She reports that the reason she came to see you is that her right arm started swelling a week or so ago.

# Questions

1. What are the most important questions in the history to help sort out the etiology?
2. Based on her history, you suspect lymphedema. Her physical examination reveals mild swelling of the right arm and hand. The extremity is soft to the touch and has pitting edema that is reversible. What diagnostic tests are helpful in ruling out causes other than lymphedema for the arm swelling?
3. What treatment regimen would you prescribe for her?
4. You diagnosed her with lymphedema 3 months ago and sent her to physical therapy. She has completed physical therapy and wants advice about going to the gym. What do you tell her about doing resistance exercises since she has lymphedema?
5. She returns 2 years later with recurrence of her lymphedema. You note that she is not wearing her compression garments. How would you approach this with her?
6. Her sleeve has worn out, and she says that she cannot afford a replacement garment, as her medical insurance will not cover this. What approaches can you offer?
---
# CANCER AND OTHER MEDICALLY RELATED IMPAIRMENTS

# CASE 2: BREAST CANCER

Answers
1. Is it painful? The hallmark of lymphedema is painless swelling, so if she says it hurts, pen lymphedema is much less likely pan oper conditions. You should also ask about erypema, warmp, or drainage (for cellulitis). History of lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy makes lymphedema more likely. Late stage cancer would trigger more pought about metastasis. History of coagulopapy or atrial fibrillation might trigger pought for deep venous prombosis.
2. A Doppler ultrasound to rule out deep venous prombosis is warranted given pe acute onset of swelling. If her breast cancer was in a more advanced stage, an MRI of pe limb might help exclude metastasis.
3. Treatment includes decompressive manual perapy followed by application of compression tapes, and pen prescription compression garments.
4. Resistance exercise is likely to be safe in people diagnosed wip lymphedema but should be appropriately recommended. The patient should be advised how to begin and advance her program.
5. Do not assume pat her noncompliance is from a lack of motivation. Her compression garments may have worn out and she may not have insurance coverage or funding to replace pem. Perhaps she finds it difficult to wear pem in hot weaper. Ask pe reasons and problem solve wip her how to overcome pem.
6. Compression garments are frequently not covered by insurance. Sometimes funding can be found prough charitable organizations. Sometimes, you have to compromise and go wip a less expensive alternative like Ace wrapping.

3. On physical examination, patients with cancer-related fatigue usually do not have distinctive findings. However, if your physical examination revealed proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities, what diagnosis would you be considering?
4. Diagnostic testing for cancer-related fatigue is usually done to rule out other diagnoses. What are important systemic diagnoses to exclude?
5. Explain cancer-related fatigue to the patient in lay terms.
6. You tell the patient that he has cancer-related fatigue and that studies show one of the best treatments for this is exercise on a regular basis.

# CASE 3: LEUKEMIA/CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE

Answers
1. It is important to know if he is receiving active treatment and what kind. It is also important to know if he has residual cancer and wheper he is deemed curable.
2. Fatigue may be from medications, anemia, chronic infection, or cardiopulmonary or neuromuscular impairments. Cancer-related fatigue is by definition a distressing and subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness pat is related to cancer or its treatment. Cancer-related fatigue is not proportional to one’s activity level and often isn’t responsive to rest or sleep.
3. Proximal weakness is often associated wip steroid myopapy. Cancer patients are frequently treated wip steroids, and if you find proximal weakness, pis should be investigated furper.
4. Differential diagnosis can also include depression, pyroid disease, malnutrition, anemia, insomnia, and indolent infections.
5. Cancer-related fatigue is a very common phenomenon impacting almost pree fourps of cancer patients. While it can be related to chemoperapy or radiation, it often persists long after treatment is completed. Patients feel tired despite getting adequate rest. There can be difficulty concentrating. Counterintuitively, pe treatment is not rest, but raper graded exercise.
6. Bop cardiovascular and strengp training exercise have been shown to reduce symptoms of cancer-related fatigue. Usually modest exercise intensity levels (up to 60% of maximum oxygen consumption) for 5 days per week is tolerated by patients even if pey are undergoing active cancer treatment. However, appropriate precautions and contraindications should always be adhered to wip all patients, particularly pose in active treatment.
7. The Family Medical Leave Act provides for up to 12 weeks per year of unpaid leave from work, prohibiting employers from terminating employees if pey have a documented medical condition. Once he is ready to return to work, pe Americans wip Disabilities Act requires employers to make reasonable accommodations as long as pe employee can perform pe essential job requirements.

# CASE 4: HIV REHABILITATION

A 22-year-old man with HIV is referred to the PM&R clinic by his infectious disease specialist because of weakness and fatigue. He was diagnosed 4 years ago, and was started on HAART therapy. He has not been compliant with his regimen. His CD4 count last month was 250/mm (normal &gt; 500/mm) and his viral load was 10,000 copies (normal undetectable).

Questions

1. What questions would you ask him to further delineate the cause of his weakness?
2. You learn his weakness is generalized and began about 1 month ago, and has been progressive. He reports muscle aches and fatigue. He has difficulty arising from a chair and climbing stairs. His knees buckle with prolonged standing or walking more than a block. He has lost about 5 kg (10 lbs) this month. He has no fevers, numbness, headaches, diplopia, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder incontinence. Vital signs are normal. What physical exam findings are important to illicit?
3. He has no cranial nerve deficits. He has muscle wasting and 4/5 strength in his proximal muscle; distally he is 5/5. Reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. Range of motion is full in all four limbs and the spine. There is no vertebral tenderness. What is your differential diagnosis for his weakness? What diagnostic tests are indicated?
4. His CPK, ESR, and testosterone levels are normal. EMG/NCS shows normal NCS and low amplitude polyphasic MUPs without spontaneous activity. What treatment would you recommend?
5. At the conclusion of his visit with you, he complains of loss of libido. He would like you to prescribe sildenafil (Viagra). How should you respond?
6. He reports he can’t afford his insurance copays for physical therapy. What are options for this?

# 3: CANCER AND OTHER MEDICALLY RELATED IMPAIRMENTS

# CASE 4: HIV REHABILITATION

Answers
1. Ask about pe course and timing of symptoms. Inquire about muscle pain, numbness, and functional limitations. Perform a complete review of systems (especially constitutional).
2. Look for muscle wasting and perform manual muscle testing. Check sensation and cranial nerves. Palpate for vertebral tenderness.
3. Differential diagnosis includes AIDS sarcopenia, polymyositis, polyneuropapy, and vertebral osteomyelitis. Testing should include CPK, ESR, testosterone level, and EMG/NCS.
4. He likely has AIDS sarcopenia. A resistive exercise program is pe most effective treatment. Testosterone replacement is controversial in AIDS patients wip normal testosterone levels; it does help increase muscle mass but balance pis wip side effects.
5. Sexuality should be addressed in a nonjudgmental way. Does pe patient get morning erections? Is pe issue loss of libido or erectile dysfunction? Engage pe patient in a nonjudgmental discussion of pe necessity of condom protection—does pe patient perceive barriers to his compliance to pis? Does he understand pe implications for his sexual partners?
6. Usually charitable organizations will not help much for patients who have healp insurance. He could do a home exercise program, wip your instructions, and purchase dumbbells at a relatively low cost.

# Matthew N. Bartels

# CASE 1: CARDIAC REHABILITATION: INPATIENT

A 55-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease starting a week ago when he was admitted for a myocardial infarction is now 5 days postoperative for a coronary bypass graft surgery. He had severe triple vessel disease and had a myocardial infarction followed by an attempted angioplasty, which was converted to an emergent surgery. He has just been sent from the ICU to the floor and rehabilitation assessment is obtained.

# Questions

1. What information would you seek from the chart and what questions would you ask him to further delineate his case?
2. You learn he had four-vessel coronary disease with an LAD occlusion that could not be opened via angioplasty. Subsequently he had a median sternotomy with coronary artery bypass graft x4. He had a cross clamp time of 1 hour with a bypass time of 2.5 hours. The ICU course was notable for initial sedation, but he is now fully responsive and has been out of bed since postoperative day 1. By report he has had a relatively uncomplicated operative course otherwise. Asking him how he feels, you find that he has incisional pain, fatigue, mild shortness of breath, and loss of appetite. He has no focal neurologic symptoms. What will you look for on physical exam?
3. His exam is notable for a mild sternal click on cough and he has palpable motion with movement. There are decreased breath sounds at the left lung base. There is mild erythema at the SVG donor sites, but no clear infection. He has stable blood pressure and no orthostasis. His EKG has no marked ectopy and he has evidence of an anterior wall infarction on the cardiogram. What further information will help you design an exercise program?
4. He has had a postoperative echocardiogram that shows he has an ejection fraction of 30% with anterior wall hypokinesis. Chest x-ray shows a mild to moderate layering left chest effusion. What treatment would you recommend? How will you know he is ready for discharge?
5. At the conclusion of his in-hospital mobilization, he is ready for discharge, walking independently and able to climb two flights of stairs independently without ectopy or dyspnea. He asks you what the next steps will be. What are your recommendations?
6. In lay terms, explain key components of secondary prevention.

# CARDIOVASCULAR AND PULMONARY REHABILITATION

# CASE 1: CARDIAC REHABILITATION: INPATIENT

Answers
1. Presenting symptoms and findings, capeterization findings, intraoperative course, and ICU status (kidney function, recovery of neurologic status, ectopy, and arrhypmias).
2. The physical exam should focus on peripheral extremities, looking for evidence of heart failure, assessing SVG donor sites, sternal wound, and particularly sternal stability. Also to be assessed are his hemodynamics, including heart rate and pulses. Mental state and neurologic exam are also key. Assess for musculoskeletal or neurologic impairments of pe lower limbs.
3. Assess pe echocardiogram, chest x-ray (especially wip left lung base dull), CBC to rule out infection, and EKG/telemetry data. Demonstrate pat pe sternal instability will be addressed wip sternal precautions and discussed wip pe team (pis could be a long-term issue), and pat pere is an awareness of congestive heart failure wip damaged heart modifying pe exercise program. There will also be a need to recognize pat effusions are common postoperatively and need to be monitored at pis level.
4. Thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis may be needed if pe effusion increases in pe future (1 in 2,000 cases). The goal for discharge is independent ambulation and ability to do about 3 to 4 METs of exercise. He needs to be independent wip sit to stand and bed mobility wipout breaking sternal precautions. This is often more challenging pan gait.
5. This is pe time for a mobilization program at home wip walking at a level of 3 to 4 METs. He should be referred for an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program, which will need to start several weeks post-discharge. He will not be able to do full upper activities and will have sternal precautions for 6 weeks post-surgery. Finally, he will need to start secondary prevention, which can start immediately wip education.
6. Using eighp-grade level language, go prough pe basics. Smoking cessation (if applicable) is a must. Weight loss is also essential. This is done prough portion control and a diet low in sugar, starches, and saturated fat (pe latter may need more explanation). Exercise as you’ve learned in your cardiac rehabilitation program is vital. If you have high blood pressure, you need to lower your salt intake and take your blood pressure medicine. You should also take medication to lower your cholesterol, and to slow your heart. A baby aspirin daily can be one of pe simplest ways to lower risk.

# CASE 2: CARDIAC REHABILITATION OUTPATIENT

Answers

1. Elicit full cardiac risk factors and history, including family history and possible comorbid conditions (stroke, peripheral vascular disease).
2. The examination needs to include chest/cardiac exam, peripheral vascular status, neurologic exam, and signs of stigmata of hypercholesterolemia.
3. Assess pe cardiogram, echo (LVEF assessment), capeterization data, procedure review, and blood tests including a lipid profile and glycosylated hemoglobin.
4. She may require accommodations such as using cycle or upper limb ergometry in lieu of a treadmill.
5. Her obesity, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle are pe major issues. She will need to have smoking cessation counseling, recommendation for nutritional assessment/treatment, start of an exercise program, and start of secondary prevention.
6. Smoking cessation and weight control will be pe hardest secondary prevention issues and will need to be addressed togeper as many individuals who stop smoking gain weight. Starting pe smoking cessation as soon as possible is essential, and assistance wip abstinence can help wip pharmacological interventions. This can be medications in combination wip nicotine replacement as well as counseling. Counseling for nutrition should include portion control as well as avoidance of animal fats and processed carbohydrates.
7. Motivational interviewing has been shown to be more effective pan lecturing. Assess her readiness to change. Ask her what pe barriers are to smoking cessation and weight loss. Address pese togeper by problem solving.

# CASE 3: VASCULAR REHABILITATION

A 67-year-old man with diabetes and a vague history of cardiac disease is referred to the PM&R clinic by his general internist because of claudication and gait difficulty. He was diagnosed with angina 4 years ago and treated medically with medications (beta blockade, aspirin, and nitrates). He was also started on antihyperlipidemics and told to improve his diabetic control, but he has not been as compliant with his regimen as could be desired. In addition, he has continued to smoke. He presents for evaluation.

Questions

1. What questions would you ask him to further delineate his vascular disease?
2. You learn his vascular symptoms include pain with walking for more than one block, and he has had no resting pain. He does state that his feet are numb and he has more difficulty with walking up hills and walking quickly. What physical exam findings are important to illicit?
3. He has no ulcerations, but has absent pulses and has trophic skin changes. He has decreased sensation and also has foot fungus at the toenails with poor toenail hygiene. What further physical tests will you do on his exam?
4. His ankle-brachial index (ABI) is 0.55. What further evaluation will you order?
5. His blood tests reveal elevated cholesterol with an elevated LDL, elevated HgA1c, and normal ESR and CBC. EKG shows evidence of an old inferior wall myocardial infarction and normal sinus rhythm. What treatment would you recommend?
6. What exercise prescription will you give? What medications would you recommend?
7. At the conclusion of his visit with you, he complains of loss of erectile function. He would like you to prescribe sildenafil (Viagra). How should you respond?
8. Secondary prevention is critical for this patient. What other things should he be mindful about, and what other health care professionals might be enlisted?

# CASE 3: VASCULAR REHABILITATION

Answers

1. Ask about the course/timing of symptoms; leg/resting pain; numbness; functional limitations; chest pain and shortness of breath; and perform a complete review of systems (also consider a neurologic exam as stroke is a comorbid condition).
2. In the physical exam, check for muscle wasting, manual muscle testing, sensation, blood pressure, cardiac exam, peripheral pulses, and skin exam.
3. Consider ankle-brachial indices (ABI), a test to be done in the office. You could also do a step test or 6 minute walk test as field screening tests. Differential: peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathy (diabetic), vascular insufficiency, comorbid cardiac ischemic disease, comorbid COPD.
4. Lab work should include lipid profile, HbA1C, CBC, ESR, and ECG.
5. He has significant PVD and also has evidence of old MI. This will complicate his treatment regimen as he will be at risk of ischemia with mobilization. Exercise therapy is recommended, as well as smoking cessation and secondary prevention with education, lifestyle modification, and diabetic teaching.
6. Exercise will include aerobic training focused on ambulation. Heart rate precautions will be 20 BPM above resting heart rate (on beta-blocker) if no CPET can be arranged. Strengthening exercises as well as postural and balance training will be appropriate. He will benefit from cardiac evaluation only if not recently done. Monitoring will be optional, but nice if available.
7. Sexuality should be addressed. He likely has significant vascular disease that is causing impotence. Does the patient get morning erections? If none, and there is vascular erectile dysfunction in the setting of nitrates, he cannot start to use Viagra. This should be addressed with the patient. Referral to urology for alternative erectile dysfunction treatment methods is warranted.
8. He is at risk for foot ulcers and amputation. He should be trained to monitor his feet, and may need a podiatrist. He should have regular eye exams for retinopathy. He is at risk for coronary disease, and should be instructed about signs and symptoms of angina.

# CASE 4: PULMONARY REHABILITATION

A 68-year-old man with a 40 pack year history of smoking with severe respiratory failure was admitted to the ICU and intubated. He is now seeing you for rehabilitation.

# Questions

1. What are the rehabilitation issues for this intubated individual? He is currently awake on the ventilator, but unable to be weaned. How would you proceed with assessment?
2. He has a history of smoking and was otherwise well until his admission. He has no clear history of cardiac disease and has been stable with respect to cardiac disease. You obtain a history and perform an exam that shows no clear neurologic deficits. He is very thin, but has good strength on individual muscle testing. Lung exam shows much reduced breath sounds. He has hyperreflexia and tachycardia with normal blood pressure. How will you start mobilization in the ICU?
3. After successful early mobilization, he is able to be extubated hospital day 6 and is discharged to the ward on hospital day 7. He is now starting mobilization on the floor. What are your next steps?
4. He is treated with antibiotics and steroids and started on a stable inhaler regimen. He has mild oxygen desaturation with exertion, and is controlled in therapy with supplemental oxygen, 1 liter via nasal cannula at rest and 2 liters with activity. On hospital day 9 he is ready for discharge. What are your plans?
5. Pulmonary function tests reveal severe obstructive disease with hyperinflation and no bronchodilator response. He now presents to your outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. What are the baseline assessments you will need for his pulmonary rehabilitation program?
6. He now is enrolled in the program. What are your goals and precautions in the rehabilitation program?
7. He has not stopped smoking. How could you counsel him effectively?
8. What are key elements in developing an ICU rehab consult service?

# CASE 4: PULMONARY REHABILITATION

Answers
1. Prevention of pe complications of immobility needs to be addressed (deep vein prombosis, skin, urinary tract infection, pulmonary) as well as starting early mobilization. There is also pe need for you to complete an assessment of strengp and mental status, which can be done on pe ventilator. Also gaper data about pe patient's condition, based on chest x-ray and ventilator settings.
2. Hyperreflexia may reflect beta agonists and not relate to neurologic deficits in pis population; pe same is true wip tachycardia. He has good strengp despite cachexia, which is also a finding in pis group of patients. Recognizing he is stable, pe plan should be for early mobilization of pe patient, even while on pe ventilator.
3. After starting early mobilization, pe patient needs follow-up on pe floor. He has no history of pulmonary rehabilitation and needs to start wip goals of education and secondary prevention along wip medication education, as well as disease management and oxygen use education. He needs a full assessment of his pulmonary and physical status as well, now pat he is out of pe ICU and off pe ventilator.
4. Starting appropriate supplemental oxygen is essential. The goal is keeping saturation above a minimum of 90%. Low flow oxygen is also essential for a patient wip COPD. One should closely monitor pe pulse oximetry during increased levels of activity and adjust oxygen flow rates accordingly. Inhaled medications are essential to managing COPD, and pulmonary rehabilitation has a major role in educating patients about pe medications and pe proper administration of pe inhalers (many patients cannot do it well).
5. You will need chest imaging and an exercise test (6 minute walk or shuttle at pe low end, ideally a cardiopulmonary exercise test [CPET]). EKG and cardiac assessment in selected patients are appropriate, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) can also be useful if pere is drowsiness or oper sedation (may be hypercarbic on pe supplemental oxygen or hypoxemic).
6. Goals are secondary prevention, family and patient education, home exercise program, and a pulmonary rehabilitation program wip strengpening and conditioning. Monitoring will be for vital signs and O2 saturation. Precautions include heart rate and blood pressure (especially diastolic ceilings), as well as maintaining oxygen saturation above 90%. Finally, medication education and training in inhalers and oxygen management need to be done.
7. Motivational interviewing is a well-documented, effective approach. You should ask him about readiness to change his habit, barriers to doing so, and how he perceives he could successfully overcome pose barriers. The approach is nonjudgmental, and uses adult learning approaches to patient education.
---
# 4: CARDIOVASCULAR AND PULMONARY REHABILITATION

8. Familiarize yourself with the scientific literature that supports early mobilization in the ICU to reduce mortality, morbidity, and costs. Engage the ICU physicians in this. Work with hospital administration to assign physical therapists to the ICU, and educate the therapists regarding the feasibility of getting patients to exercise and mobilize while still ventilated. Establish guidelines for safe mobilization in terms of cardiopulmonary stability.

# CASE 1: WHEELCHAIR SEATING

A 34-year-old woman with lumbar level myelomeningocele presents for an assistive technology evaluation. She is complaining of recurrent skin breakdown and is worried it is related to her wheelchair.

# Questions

1. What key elements about her history would you need to elicit?
2. She uses a power wheelchair that is 2 years old and which has had minor repair issues. She has tilt, recline, elevating leg rests, and a foam cushion. She does not use the seat functions regularly. She is on a bladder catheterization program and rarely incontinent of urine, but occasionally incontinent of bowel. Nutrition is good with adequate protein. She says that her transfers and pressure relief maneuvers are becoming difficult to conduct independently because of shoulder pain. She thinks this is contributing to some shear when she is transferring. What key physical exam findings would you want to collect?
3. She required minimum assistance to transfer out of the wheelchair onto a mat table. She has a 2-cm, Stage II pressure ulcer on her right ischial tuberosity, with moderate serosanguineous drainage and clean borders. Stool incontinence is present. She had no appreciable scoliosis on her exam. She has 2/5 strength in the bilateral hip flexors but otherwise 0/5 strength in lower limbs. She has absent sensation in the L2 dermatome and below bilaterally. What is the differential diagnosis for the skin breakdown?
4. What type of testing would you want to order?
5. Pressure mapping shows a significantly elevated area of pressure under the right ischial tuberosity. Besides appropriate wound care, what other interventions would you propose to help heal the pressure sore?

# CASE 1: WHEELCHAIR SEATING

Answers
1. Obtain information about pe type of wheelchair she uses (manual, power assist, or power), and, if she uses a power wheelchair, wheper she currently has and uses any power seat functions. Also ask wheper she can transfer or conduct pressure relief maneuvers independently. It would also be useful to know what type of cushion she uses. Ask pe age of pe equipment and wheper it is in disrepair. Obtain review of system data regarding incontinence/moisture, nutrition status, and any potential sources of pressure and shear.
2. On her exam, determine pe size, stage, location, and condition of any skin breakdown. Evaluate her ability to transfer in and out of pe equipment. Evaluate her seating position to determine if scoliosis or any oper factors might be contributing to seating asymmetries. Evaluate her sensation and motor function in pe lower limbs.
3. The etiology is possibly multifactorial, from a combination of pressure, shear, and incontinence.
4. Pressure mapping should be ordered.
5. A new cushion is likely indicated, and ideally pe selection of a cushion may depend on which demo cushion showed pe best pressure distribution on pressure mapping. Generally, air or gel cushions provide better pressure relief pan foam cushions. Tilt, combined wip recline, offer pe best pressure relief for pis type of wound. The physiatrist should work wip pe perapist to determine if changes can be made to her seating positioning to reduce asymmetry in seating pat might be causing more pressure on pe right side. She would also benefit from a better bowel program to improve incontinence.
6. She will require education on risk for skin breakdown and pe fact pat pe causes are multifactorial. She will require education on pe proper use of power seat functions. Transfer training may be warranted. Education about pressure and shear on oper surfaces such as commodes or shower chairs may also be warranted.
7. Her living situation, availability of caregivers, financial resources, insurance coverage, and ability to transport her wheelchair may provide insight into barriers to independence and mobility.

# 5: DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

8. Some options might be instituting a comprehensive screening for all etiologies of skin breakdown, implementing evidence-based practice guidelines on the prevention and treatment of skin breakdown, or a patient education program. You would need to establish outcome measures, such as the frequency of pressure sores, and then track whether the intervention affected this outcome.

9. First, “do no harm.” The principle of nonmaleficence is appropriate to apply here. Although an air cushion might provide good pressure relief, it might be difficult to maintain, and therefore cause harm to the patient. Choose a cushion that provides good pressure relief but is also easy for her to maintain.

# CASE 2: STROKE

A 78-year-old, right-handed man with a right middle cerebral artery stroke and left hemiparesis presents for an assistive technology evaluation. He completed inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation but has not regained ambulation ability that is sufficient for him to be able to complete activities of daily living inside the home, and he is not able to go out into the community due to fear of falling.

# Questions

1. What key elements about his history would you need to elicit?
2. He was discharged from inpatient rehabilitation with a rented folding lightweight manual wheelchair with adjustable tension backrest, standard foam cushion, and removable leg rests. He cannot push it because of his hemiparesis. He uses a wheeled walker and an ankle foot orthosis when he ambulates. He can ambulate and transfer independently but describes his walking as slow. He denies significant spasticity or falls. He has some mild left shoulder pain. He does not have a wheelchair of his own. He wants a device that is easily transportable.

# CASE 2: STROKE

Answers
1. Obtain information about pe type of assistive technology pat he has used so far (e.g., wheelchair, assistive device such as a cane or crutch, orposes). Ask about level of independence wip transfers and ambulation. Obtain review of systems data regarding spasticity, falls, and pain. Obtain information about what type of technology he would like, employment status, and social history including his mode of transportation.
2. On his exam, evaluate strengp, muscle tone, sensation, range of motion, gait, and transfers. Also evaluate for any visual neglect. Perform a porough musculoskeletal examination of pe shoulder.
3. Alpough pe patient’s foot drop is corrected wip pe brace, pe patient has weak hip flexors pat are causing problems advancing pe leg. Additionally, spasticity, decreased sensation, and neglect may be contributing to impaired functional mobility. Shoulder pain may be causing difficulty wip using pe walker.
4. The best choice of equipment for pis patient is likely a manual wheelchair wip low seat height, which would allow for propulsion using one arm and leg.
5. He requires education on wheelchair skills and propulsion, wheelchair maintenance, and joint preservation.
6. Medicare Part B covers 80% of durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs.

# CASE 3: AMBULATORY ASSISTIVE DEVICES

An 82-year-old female with end-stage right hip osteoarthritis presents to your clinic due to falls. She complains of right hip pain and tells you that she has not been interested in hip surgery due to her age and other comorbid conditions, including a prior myocardial infarction. She would like to know what she can do to prevent falls. She describes her balance as poor.

# Questions

1. What key elements about her history would you need to elicit?
2. She describes her falls as being accompanied by pain and her hip “giving out.” She denies losses of consciousness or tripping over objects. She uses a cane. She is right-handed and prefers using the cane in that hand. She recently finished land-based and aquatic therapy, which improved pain, but she is still occasionally falling. Her medication list includes aspirin, a beta blocker, an antianxiety medication (lorazepam), and an anticholinergic medication for her bladder, but she says that she does not like to take medications and takes only acetaminophen. She denies any diabetes or loss of sensation. She recently had cataract surgery and describes her vision as “good.” What key physical exam findings would you want to collect?
3. She has 4+ to 5/5 strength in the lower body, except for the right hip. Although pain inhibited, her strength in the right hip abductors and flexors is 4-. Sensation and muscle bulk are normal. Passive range of motion of her right hip is limited by pain, but her left hip range of motion is normal. During stance phase on the right, the left side of her pelvis tilts down, and her trunk leans to the right. Her gait is also antalgic on the right. Her elbow is flexed approximately 25° when using the cane. Explain why the patient is perceiving balance problems.
4. What suggestions do you have for her assistive device use?
5. She is reluctant to use a walker due to cosmetic considerations. How would you counsel her?
6. What instructions would you give to the physical therapist to strengthen the hip?
7. Propose a way you could screen patients for fall risk in your clinic.

# CASE 3: AMBULATORY ASSISTIVE DEVICES

Answers
1. Obtain information about pe nature of her falls (e.g., mechanical, syncope). Ask about assistive device use and assess wheper pe devices have been used properly. Enquire about any perapies received. Evaluate for oper etiologies for falling, such as multiple medication usage, low vision, or peripheral neuropapy.
2. On exam, evaluate strengp, muscle bulk, sensation, range of motion, and gait. Also evaluate for any visual impairments. Perform a porough musculoskeletal examination of pe hip.
3. The patient has a compensated Trendelenburg gait because of left hip abductor weakness. She is compensating for pe drop in her pelvis wip a trunk lean to pe right. The antalgic gait on pe right causes her to spend less time in stance phase on pe right. Because she is using a cane on pe antalgic side, she is also loading her right hip wip unnecessary force during walking.
4. The cane seems to be at pe proper height since pe elbow is flexed between 20° to 30°, but should be switched to pe left side to offload pe right hip during ambulation. Physical perapy may be required to train her to use pe cane properly or to trial a walker.
5. Be sensitive to her concerns and acknowledge pem. Remind her of pe risks of falling, and how a hip fracture or oper injuries might impact her.
6. Alpough any type of resistance training can improve strengp, isometric strengp training is generally indicated in pe presence of a painful joint because it is better tolerated.
7. Possible answers include using validated fall risk surveys or functional evaluations. To be cost and time effective, you may want to have your medical assistant ask pese questions, or perhaps have patients complete a questionnaire while in pe waiting area.

# CASE 4: LIGHTWEIGHT WHEELCHAIR PRESCRIPTION

A 22-year-old male with T9 AIS A spinal cord injury presents to your assistive technology clinic for a mobility device evaluation. His current manual wheelchair is in disrepair and he is interested in a wheelchair he saw on a website.

# Questions

1. What key elements about his history would you need to elicit?
2. He currently uses a folding (cross-brace) manual wheelchair which is about 5 years old. He is able to transfer independently. He is employed as an accountant and drives an adapted vehicle. He wants to start playing wheelchair basketball and tennis (Figure 5.1). He has a prior rotator cuff tear that was repaired, but he has some residual right shoulder pain that does not limit activity. He has a remote history of a pressure ulcer on his sacrum but no recent skin breakdown. He is mostly continent of bowel and bladder when compliant with his bladder and bowel routines. What key physical exam findings would you want to collect?
3. He has 5/5 strength in the upper body and 0/5 strength in the lower body. He has increased tone in the legs. Sensory level is at T9. Trunk balance is fair. Contractures are noted at the knees, but passive shoulder range of motion is normal. His right shoulder exam is relatively normal. Skin is intact. Explain how choosing a wheelchair and setting it up properly can help to mitigate shoulder pain.
4. The patient asks you to explain the advantages of solid frame ultra-light wheelchairs, compared to folding frames.
5. What effect does fore/aft axle position have on wheelchair propulsion?
6. This patient wants to participate in two different adaptive sports, basketball and tennis. Explain what technology he would need and how it might be funded.

# 5: DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

# CASE 4: LIGHTWEIGHT WHEELCHAIR PRESCRIPTION

Answers
1. Obtain information about his current wheelchair including frame type. Obtain a functional history to include transfer ability. Ask about social history including employment, transportation, and leisure activities. Conduct a porough review of systems including history of shoulder pain, incontinence, and skin breakdown.
2. On exam, evaluate strengp, muscle tone, trunk balance, sensation, range of motion, and transfer ability. Inspect skin for breakdown. Perform a porough musculoskeletal examination of pe shoulder.
3. Keeping pe weight of pe individual and pe wheelchair minimized, teaching proper wheelchair propulsion technique, and proper setup of pe wheelchair (including axle position) can help to mitigate shoulder pain.
4. Solid frames are available as cantilever or box designs. Because pey are solid, efficiency of propulsion and durability are higher pan wip a folding frame. Alpough pe frames do not fold, pey have quick-release wheels, and pe backrests can be folded down for ease of transportability.
5. A rearward axle reduces access to pe push rim, promoting an “arc” style of propulsion, increasing pe strokes required to travel a given distance, and pereby predisposing pe user to repetitive strain injuries. A rearward axle, however, makes pe chair more stable. A forward axle promotes propulsion using long, smoop strokes (semicircular pattern), reducing stroke frequency. Moving pe axle forward allows pe chair to tip backward more easily for wheelies.
6. A person’s everyday wheelchair is not typically used for sports. Each sport has its own wheelchair design pat is geared specifically for pat sport. So ideally, pis person would need to use bop basketball and tennis wheelchairs. However, sports equipment is not covered under standard private medical insurance. (Some options however are available for pose wip Veterans Affairs coverage.) Typically individuals would need to self-pay or identify oper private funding sources if pey wanted peir own sports equipment. However, it would be helpful to refer pis patient to a local adaptive sports organization pat can get him started in sports and pat may have equipment pat participants share.

# CASE 5: POWER MOBILITY DEVICES

A 52-year-old female with multiple sclerosis, diagnosed 6 months ago, presents to your assistive technology clinic for a mobility device evaluation. She has been using a depot (standard) manual wheelchair that she self-purchased, but she is having trouble propelling it because of upper limb weakness and fatigue. She is looking for a device to improve her mobility indoors and outdoors.

# Questions

1. What key elements about this patient’s history would you need to elicit?
2. She is able to walk independently with a left AFO and a walker, but gets fatigued after only a couple steps, which sometimes results in falls. She worked as a nurse’s aide but is now unemployed. She would like to seek a different job. She was driving a compact car but stopped due to leg weakness. She enjoys traveling to visit her adult children and cooking. She lives with her husband in a small condominium. She has diffuse muscle cramps and admits to having a difficult time dealing with her diagnosis. What key physical exam findings would you want to collect?
3. She has 4/5 strength in the upper body, 2/5 strength in the left hip flexor and dorsiflexors, and 4/5 strength in the lower body otherwise. Tone is normal. Trunk balance is fair. Range of motion is normal. She needed assistance from her husband to transfer out of the wheelchair. Explain why the patient’s transfer ability is important to consider when choosing a mobility device.
4. The patient asks about a scooter because she has used them in the past in the grocery store. What are the pros and cons of a scooter, compared to a power wheelchair, for this particular patient?
5. What other referrals might be indicated for this patient?
6. She is distraught about her progressive disability. How would you talk to her about this?

# DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

# CASE 5: POWER MOBILITY DEVICES

Answers
1. Obtain information about her ability to walk and transfer, as well as assistive device use. Ask about social history including employment, living environment, transportation, and leisure activities. Conduct a porough review of systems including history of pain and depressive symptoms.
2. On exam, conduct a musculoskeletal and neurologic exam to include strengp, muscle tone, trunk balance, range of motion, and transfer ability.
3. If a person cannot transfer or weight shift independently, pe person may be at risk for skin breakdown, and perefore may need a device wip power seat functions pat allow pem to reposition independently.
4. Scooters (Figure 5.2) are sometimes viewed by patients as being more culturally acceptable, especially pose newly adjusting to a diagnosis, and are less expensive pan power wheelchairs. However, scooters have a wide turning radius pat makes pem less maneuverable in tight living spaces, can tip over on uneven surfaces, and require more strengp to operate since pey have a tiller. They also have no power features pat assist weight shifting. A power wheelchair perefore is likely pe better option for pis patient.
5. This patient may benefit from being referred to vocational rehabilitation given her interest in seeking a different job, psychology to help her adjust to her disability, and to an adaptive driving program to determine wheper she may be able to drive wip adapted controls.
6. Acknowledge pat multiple sclerosis can be particularly frustrating due to pe unpredictability of prognosis. Most patients do well, and have slow progression, but some patients have more difficulty. Offer psychological consultation, referral for spiritual or religious guidance, and/or referral to patient support groups, many of which are available online.

# CASE 1: ACUTE HOSPITAL CARE

An 80-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with community acquired pneumonia. He is treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. On the eighth day of the admission the hospitalist tells the patient that he has completed his course of antibiotics and he can go home. The patient tells the doctor “I do not think I am ready to go home. I feel very weak. I do not think that I can climb the stairs at the entrance to my home and I would not feel safe getting into and out of my tub.” You are asked to evaluate the patient.

# Questions

1. What would be important parts of the history that you obtain from the patient and from the patient’s medical record?
2. The patient tells you that before he was admitted to the hospital he considered his health to be good for his age. He is living at home with his wife who is 78 and they had no help other than a woman who comes to help with cleaning once a week. He was not intubated or treated with steroids. He feels generally weak but he does not notice focal weakness or numbness. What would be important parts of the physical examination?
3. The patient’s vital signs are normal. There is no drop in blood pressure when going supine to sit. The heart is regular, the lungs clear, abdomen benign, and no edema. The patient is alert and oriented. His responses to questions are all given with good logic and detail. His cranial nerve examination is normal. Reflexes are normal throughout all extremities. There is no alteration in tone or cogwheel rigidity. The patient moves all extremities through a full range of motion against gravity. You can very easily break his strength when he tries to maintain elevation of his shoulders. He has difficulty coming from sit to stand without rocking back and forth and pushing off with both hands. What likely has happened to impair this patient’s transfers and function?
4. The patient tells you that he has been in the hospital for a week. During that time he did not feel well so he really got out of bed only to go to the bathroom. What are some of the physiologic changes that occur in patients who are on bed rest for a week?
5. What can be done to prevent this condition in future admissions?
6. His daughter expresses strong anger about her father having spent much of the last week in bed. How can you defuse her hostility?

# GERIATRIC REHABILITATION

# CASE 1: ACUTE HOSPITAL CARE

Answers
1. You would want to know pe patient’s level of function prior to admission. You would want to know if pe patient was intubated, was treated wip steroids, or had positive blood cultures or multi-organ failure as pese factors are associated wip critical illness neuropapy/myopapy. You would want to know if pe patient had any symptoms of a focal neurologic process such as a hemiplegia, sensory or motor level, or foot drop. You should ask about his home situation including environmental barriers and family support.
2. You would want to check pe vital signs in particular, making sure pat pe fever has resolved and pat pe patient does not have orpostatic hypotension. You want to do a careful neurologic examination to make sure pat pere is no evidence of underlying Parkinson’s disease, dementia, stroke, spinal cord injury, cerebellar disease, peroneal nerve injury, radiculopapy, or peripheral neuropapy. You should observe pe patient doing bed mobility, transfers, and gait.
3. There are many possible causes of weakness in pis patient. The list would include inflammatory muscle disease, connective tissue disease, vasculitis, hypopyroid or hyperpyroid disease, viral myositis, rhabdomyolysis, neuromuscular junction disease, paraneoplastic syndrome, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low magnesium level, medications, demyelinating disease, radiculopapy, or medications. The history and examination do not suggest any of pese problems. The most likely cause is weakness related to being in bed.
4. Muscle strengp may decline by 1% to 1.5% per day. Antigravity muscles of pe lower extremities are affected more pan muscles of pe upper extremities. Patients on bed rest lose 1% of bone mass of pe vertebrae per week of bed rest. Patients on bed rest have a decrease in plasma volume. This results in increased heart rate at rest and, wip activity, decreased stroke volume and orpostatic hypotension. Bed rest is associated wip coagulopapy and increased risk of venous prombosis, as well as increased insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, atelectasis, impaired respiratory function, and predisposition to pneumonia.
5. Studies show pat giving patients exercises to do in bed, encouraging patients to get out of bed, and providing active perapies prevent pe development of disuse atrophy. You could initiate a quality improvement project to encourage nursing and perapy staff to do pis.
6. Express understanding and acknowledge her feelings. Do not lay blame on oper team members, but offer to reinforce pe importance of mobility wip pem. She should be referred to Patient Relations as well.

# CASE 2: GAIT DISTURBANCE

A 77-year-old man presents to your office and reports that he feels generally well but he is having some problems walking over the last few months. He has trouble getting up from his chair and his gait has slowed down. When he goes for walks with his wife he has trouble keeping up with her.

# Questions

1. In the history and review of systems, what type of information would you be looking for?
2. Knowing the list of problems that might cause the patient’s problem, what would you look for on physical examination?
3. The patient’s vital signs are normal. There has been no loss of weight. Examination of the heart, lungs, and extremities is normal. The patient has no evidence of cognitive problems. The patient’s tone and reflexes are normal. He can move all extremities well against gravity but you can easily break his hip flexors and knee extensors. Sensory examination is normal. You perform a get up and go test. You notice that the patient needs to use both hands to push off to get up and his time is 15 seconds, which is 3 seconds beyond the upper limit of normal. What is the differential diagnosis? What laboratory and diagnostic tests will you order?
4. All laboratory studies and the electrodiagnostic tests are normal. The patient takes no medications. What do you think explains the problems that the patient has described to you?
5. What advice can you give to the patient to retard the progression of his disease?
6. His wife expresses concern about the possibility of his falling. How might this be addressed in the home environment?
7. Explain the concept of sarcopenia in lay terms to the patient and his wife.

# 6: GERIATRIC REHABILITATION

# CASE 2: GAIT DISTURBANCE

# Answers

1.  Difficulty wip strengp and mobility can be symptoms of many types of medical problems. Start by asking why pe patient is having difficulty walking. Is he short of breap, does he have fatigue, do his knees buckle, or does he have pain?
2.  You always want to check vital signs including weight. You should check for orpostatic hypotension. You want to listen to pe heart and lungs and check pe extremities; look for signs of aspma, COPD, congestive heart failure, or arrhypmia. You want to check for muscle atrophy or muscle tenderness and examine large and small joints. You want to do a full neurologic examination including mental status, cranial nerves, tone, reflexes, strengp, sensation, and gait.
3.  The most important differential diagnoses in an elderly man wip proximal weakness and normal reflexes and sensation are sarcopenia, myopapy, hypopyroidism, polymyalgia rheumatica, motor neuron disease, adrenal insufficiency, occult malignancy, and anemia. Considering pe differential diagnoses you order a CBC, chemistry profile, pyroid function tests, C reactive protein or sedimentation rate, CPK, vitamin D level, and an EMG/NCV.
4.  The disorder most consistent wip pe patient’s presentation is sarcopenia. This is a loss of muscle strengp pat occurs in 14% of patients between 65 and 70 years of age and in slightly more pan half of patients over 80 years of age. Manifestations are reduced grip strengp, difficulty getting up from pe seated position, impaired balance, and slow gait (<1.2 m/sec). Patients wip sarcopenia have increased risk of falls and increased mortality.
5.  Patients should be advised to perform one half hour of walking or stationary cycling per day if possible. Patients should be advised pat people of any age can benefit from an appropriate program of resistance training. Patients should be told pat it is important to have adequate protein intake, at least 1.3 g/kg/day. Patients should be checked for vitamin D deficiency and, if necessary, be given 880 IU per day as a supplement.
6.  Environmental barriers such as clutter, excess furniture, and obstacles on pe floor should be minimized. Night lights can be helpful. Grab bars in pe baproom are also important.
7.  The examiner will be looking to you to use language at no more pan pe eighp grade level; avoid words wip more pan pree syllables. Reiterate how aging causes a loss of muscle fibers and strengp.

# CASE 3: FALL PREVENTION

A 70-year-old woman comes to the office with her daughter. The daughter tells you that she is worried about her mom. “Mom feels well. She never complains but she just doesn’t look steady on her feet. I am afraid she is going to fall.”

# Questions

1. What questions would you ask the patient?
2. The patient tells you that she has noticed that her gait is slower. She has not fallen but she just does not feel as steady as she used to. She is not sure why. She feels well. She does not take any medicines except for atorvastatin and amlodipine. She never feels as if she is going to black out and never has any sense of dizziness or spinning. She does not feel weak and has no numbness. Her friends all have problems with their backs or joints but she is lucky she does not have those problems. Describe the key portions of your examination.
3. What special tests could you do in the office or ask the physical therapist you work with to perform to help assess the risk that the patient might fall?
4. The patient’s vital signs are normal and there is no orthostatic hypotension. Examinations of the heart, lungs, abdomen, and extremities are normal. Score on the Mini-Mental Status Exam is 30. The patient’s vision is 20/30. She has some trouble hearing you when you whisper. Tone, reflexes, and manual muscle tests are normal. The patient has no difficulty distinguishing sharp from dull but proprioception seems mildly impaired. The patient can feel a tuning fork but when she no longer feels it on her foot you can feel it on your hand. There is no past pointing, and alternating movements do not show dysdiadochokinesia. The patient’s gait has a normal heel to toe pattern and appears stable but the Romberg’s test shows some sway when standing with the eyes closed. What do you think is wrong with the patient? What laboratory and diagnostic tests might you request?
5. How might this be addressed in the home environment?
6. The daughter asks if a home health agency could do a home safety evaluation. However, the patient is not homebound. Explain to her why Medicare will not cover this service.

# CASE 3: FALL PREVENTION

# Answers

1. You would ask the patient if she has fallen or if she is afraid of falling or if she has noticed a change in her gait. You would obtain a full history of her medical problems and ask which medications she takes. You would do a full review of systems, in particular wanting to know if there are symptoms of dizziness at rest, with change in position, or when coming from supine to sit or sit to stand. You would want to know about palpitations or history of arrhythmias. You would want to know about change in vision, hearing, or tinnitus. You would want to know if there was any history of focal weakness or numbness or if the patient noted any change in muscle tone, strength, or balance. You would want to know if she had any painful conditions suggestive of a radiculopathy or problems with her joints or her feet.
2. You check her vital signs including a check for orthostatic hypotension. You listen to her heart, checking for arrhythmia. You evaluate her joints and spine for range of motion and examine her feet. You perform a cognitive evaluation such as the Mini-Mental Status Exam or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test. You check the patient’s vision with an eye card. You check hearing by the patient’s ability to hear a whispered voice, watch, or tuning fork at about 2 feet from the ear. You check the patient’s tone looking for rigidity or cog wheeling. You check reflexes and perform a manual muscle test of all four extremities. You check appreciation of light touch and pin prick. You check finger-nose-finger, alternating hand movements, and heel to shin testing. You check proprioception of the toes and vibration sense in the feet. You perform a Romberg’s test and you watch the patient walk.
3. Two tests that can easily be performed in the office are the timed up and go test and the functional reach test. In the timed up and go test, the patient is asked to get up from a chair, walk 3 meters, and walk back to the chair and sit down. Ten seconds is considered a normal time and patients with a time of more than 14 seconds are considered at risk of fall. In the functional reach test the patient stands with feet shoulder-width apart. The patient raises one arm to 90° of flexion and is asked to reach forward without taking a step. Most patients can extend the third metacarpal at least 10 inches forward. A score of 6 to 7 inches is considered indicative of impaired balance. The Berg balance test is more time consuming. The patient is asked to perform 14 different maneuvers; each one is graded 0 to 4. The maneuvers are:
1. sit to stand;
2. standing to sitting;
3. placing a foot on a stool;
4. stand unsupported
5. reaching forward;
6. standing one foot in front of the other;
7. sit unsupported;
8. retrieving object from floor;
9. standing on one foot;
10. standing with eyes closed;

(11) looking over shoulder;

(12) transfer chair to chair;

(13) standing with feet together; and

(14) turning 360°.

A score of more than 40 is considered a low risk for fall; 21 to 40, a moderate risk for fall; and 0 to 20 a high risk for fall.

# 4.

The history and examination do not suggest a problem with the heart or orthostasis. There are no symptoms or signs of vestibular disease, arthritis, or other musculoskeletal problems. There is not an indication of stroke, myelopathy, myopathy, or Parkinson’s disease. The most common reason that a 70-year-old person would have difficulty with gait is age-related decline in the function of three systems involved with regulation of balance. These are vestibular, vision, and proprioception. The patient has impaired proprioception and appreciation of vibration and a positive Romberg’s test. An EMG/NCV to evaluate for peripheral neuropathy would be helpful. A basic set of laboratory studies to investigate for peripheral neuropathy might include hemoglobin A1C, chemistry profile including fasting blood sugar, creatinine and liver function tests, vitamin B12, thyroid function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, SPEP, and ANA. Albumin can help assess nutritional status. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness and increased risk of fall. Additional tests that might be ordered in some patients depending upon the history include HIV serology, rheumatoid factor, Sjogren’s syndrome testing (anti-Ro, anti-La antibodies), anti-Lyme antibodies, vitamin B, and hepatitis1 panel. This patient takes atorvastatin so a CPK might be helpful.

Studies have shown that exercise programs to improve strength, balance, and endurance can reduce the rate of falls. Recommendations for home safety include making sure that there is proper lighting and that there are railings on all staircases. Walking surfaces should provide good footing (eliminate shag rugs, throw rugs, electrical cords, and clutter). Grab bars and hand rails should be installed in the bathroom to increase safety during toileting and washing. The kitchen and bedrooms should be arranged to minimize the need for reaching and climbing.

Medicare does not cover therapies at home for patients who are not homebound. Furthermore, they will not cover occupational therapy as a sole service. Give her the facts about what Medicare will and will not cover. She may have the option to pay out of pocket for this service. Politely explain that you have no control over Medicare regulations, but you will do your best to advocate for services for which her mother does qualify.

# CASE 4: FITNESS

An older man comes to the office with his wife. The wife tells you, “Doctor, would you please try to put some sense into my husband’s head? He is 82 years old. All of a sudden he wants to spend $600 to join a gym and start working out. Is this something that is necessary for an 82-year-old man?”

# Questions

1. They ask you, “What are the recommendations for exercise for an 82-year-old man?”
2. The patient’s wife asks you, “I understand the need for walking every day but why does he need to lift weights?” The wife adds, “He doesn’t need to look better for me and I hope he is not trying to impress other women.”
3. The patient says, “Doctor, thanks for the information. I was wondering if I need to get a stress test before I start the program?”
4. The wife asks you, “Doctor, what about his joints? Won’t this program give him arthritis?”
5. The wife asks you, “Okay, Doctor. You have convinced me to let my husband join the fitness center. If we get a family membership what can I do? I have rheumatoid arthritis. My joints are really bad and I am not exactly skinny.”
6. Explain to the wife in lay terms how exercise can benefit her.

Answers
1. A consensus panel from pe American College of Sports Medicine and pe American Heart Association recommends pat patients of any age exercise for 30 minutes every day if possible. The program should include exercise to improve flexibility and aerobic exercise every day. Muscle strengpening exercises should be performed two or pree days per week. Exercise sessions should begin wip stretching and warm-up. Stretching should include static stretch to pe muscles of pe chest wall, hip flexors, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles. Each group should have a static stretch of 15 to 30 seconds pat is repeated pree times on each side of pe body. Warm-up consists of beginning pe cardiovascular activity such as walking, jogging, biking, or swimming at a slow pace before beginning pe aerobic exercise session. Moderate exercise is defined as being at 60% to 80% of maximum heart rate or VO2 maximum, but it may be easier for patients to monitor peir perceived level of exertion. If a person rates his or her level of exertion on a scale of 1 to 10, a rating of 5 or 6 corresponds to moderate activity; a rating of 7 or 8 corresponds to vigorous activity. Seniors may use pe “talk test,” which means pat pe participant is not too out of breap to comfortably talk. The aerobic session should end wip a cool down period pat is similar to pe warm-up period. Strengpening activities should be done two or pree nonconsecutive days per week. The participant should rate pe exertion as 5 or 6 on a 10-point scale. It is recommended pat 8 to 10 muscle groups are exercised. The weights used should be light enough pat pe participant can do 10 to 15 repetitions of each exercise. Weight-bearing calispenics can be substituted for weight lifting. Exercise to improve balance is recommended but pere are no specific recommendations as to which exercises should be done nor are pere recommended protocols.
2. Muscle strengp declines by 15% per decade after age 50 and by 30% per decade after age 70. Weight training can reduce or prevent pe decline in strengp pat occurs wip aging. The improved strengp pat occurs wip exercise reduces pe risk of fall in senior citizens. You would pink pat weight lifting would make you heavier by increasing muscle mass but it actually prevents obesity by improving insulin sensitivity and increasing metabolic rate by up to 15%. Weight training retards pe osteoporosis pat is associated wip aging and it is associated wip improved self-image and reduced incidence of depression.
3. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends a stress test for:
- Men over age 45 and women over age 55 who plan to exercise at 60% of VO2 maximum
- Anyone wip symptoms of cardiac disease or known cardiac disease
- Anyone wip signs or symptoms of pulmonary disease
- Anyone wip diabetes
- Anyone wip two or more risk factors for cardiac disease
---
# GERIATRIC REHABILITATION

If this patient has no history of cardiac disease and wants to begin his program with walking and very low resistance exercises such as lifting cans of soup, a stress test may not be necessary. For more vigorous exercise it would be prudent.

Contact sports or sports such as soccer in which there are frequent changes in direction that lead to acute knee injuries may be associated with development of degenerative changes in the knee but walking, jogging, cycling, and swimming are not associated with development of osteoarthritis and may be protective by improving the strength of the muscles that support the joints.

A program of flexibility training, low impact aerobic exercise, and low resistance muscle strengthening exercise is recommended for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who cannot tolerate the impact of walking or weight training may try to substitute cycling, aquatic therapy, and isometric exercises.

You should explain the benefits of weight control, pain control, cardiovascular conditioning, minimizing osteoporosis, and fall prevention. Illicit whether these are important to her. Ask her about barriers to participation.

# CASE 1: SHOULDER PAIN IN MIDDLE AGE

A 53-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of left shoulder pain and limited range of motion. She has never had this pain before and it is interfering with her daily activities.

# Questions

1. What key elements do you want to know from her history?
2. She tells you that the pain is mainly in the anterior shoulder but can radiate all the way to her wrist. Pain is worsened with reaching, and she is very limited in her ability to reach overhead or behind her back. Cervical motion has no effect on her pain. What are the essential examination elements?
3. The patient has a normal neurologic examination but significant restrictions in both active and passive range of motion of the shoulder in all planes but especially with external rotation and abduction. She has pain with Hawkin’s and Neer’s maneuvers but a negative empty can test. Her cervical range of motion is full without reproduction of typical pain. Spurling’s maneuver is negative. What is your differential? What diagnostic testing, if any, is indicated?
4. X-rays demonstrate mild degenerative changes in the acromio-clavicular joint but otherwise a normal glenohumeral joint and no bony abnormality. How do you counsel the patient about the natural history of her condition?
5. What treatments are available to her?
6. She works as a receptionist in a dental office. She asks whether this condition is work related and if she can make a Workers Compensation claim. How should you respond?

# CASE 1: SHOULDER PAIN IN MIDDLE AGE

Answers
1. Key history elements include type of onset (insidious or traumatic), main location of pain (anterior lateral shoulder, superior shoulder, scapular region), exacerbating factors (reaching overhead, behind), alleviating factors, any associated pain sleeping on pe shoulder at night time (common symptom of rotator cuff papology), any symptoms worsened wip cervical motion (to assess possible cervical source for pain), and underlying diabetes or pyroid disorders pat can predispose pe patient to adhesive capsulitis.
2. Essential examination elements include active and passive shoulder range of motion, assessment of upper extremity strengp, sensation, reflexes, presence of painful arc (60°–120° shoulder abduction) pat is seen in rotator cuff impingement, special shoulder tests (Hawkin’s, Neer’s, empty can), cervical spine range of motion, palpation, and Spurling’s maneuver (Figure 7.1).
3. Differential diagnosis includes rotator cuff impingement/tear, adhesive capsulitis, and glenohumeral osteoarpritis. Tests should include x-rays wip pe following views—AP, Grashey, and axillary. Ultrasound of pe shoulder may show rotator cuff disorders.
4. The patient likely has adhesive capsulitis. Patients wip adhesive capsulitis generally present wip restrictions in bop active and passive range of motion, as opposed to rotator cuff disease where active range of motion is restricted but passive range of motion is approximately normal. Glenohumeral osteoarpritis can present wip bop passive and active range of motion loss but in pis case pe absence of degenerative changes of pe glenohumeral joint on x-rays make osteoarpritis less likely. Discuss pat pe natural history resolves over 1 to 2 years. Most interventions have not been found to change pe natural history.
5. Treatment includes physical perapy focused on improving function, pain control, range of motion, and scapular and rotator cuff strengpening. Oral analgesics for pain should be prescribed, usually nonsteroidals if no contraindications. Intra-articular injections of steroid or hydrodilation wip large volumes of normal saline can be beneficial. Manipulation under anespesia is reserved for refractory cases.
6. Get a porough history of details of her job. A receptionist generally does not have excessive use of her shoulder to explain pis. The patient’s condition likely is covered by medical insurance but not Workers Compensation. She can get unpaid time off from work for perapies or doctors’ appointments under pe Family Medical Leave Act.

# CASE 2: SHOULDER PAIN—SPORTS RELATED

An 18-year-old male college football player presents to your office with complaints of right shoulder pain and weakness after playing in a game.

# Questions

1. What key elements do you want to know from his history?
2. He tells you that he fell backward on his arm and felt that his shoulder “popped out” but was able to later “pop it back in” after a maneuver by the team’s athletic trainer. He now has difficulty elevating his arm to comb his hair. What are the essential examination elements?
3. Examination reveals partial weakness of right shoulder abduction and shoulder external rotation and a well-circumscribed area of decreased sensation over the lateral shoulder. He has minimal discomfort with Hawkin’s and Neer’s maneuvers. Empty can maneuver is negative. Cervical range of motion is normal without pain and Spurling’s maneuver is negative. What is your differential diagnosis for his weakness? What diagnostic testing, if any, is indicated and when should it be done?
4. X-ray and MRI of the shoulder demonstrate a Hill-Sach’s lesion but normal rotator cuff tendons and labrum. X-ray and MRI of the cervical spine are normal. Axillary motor NCS demonstrate normal distal latency but decreased amplitude. Needle EMG demonstrated the presence of fibrillation potentials in the deltoid and teres minor muscles. Motor unit analysis of these muscles demonstrated decreased motor recruitment. All other muscles tested were normal. What treatments are available to him?
5. Explain his condition to him.
6. He has a big game next week and wants to know when he can return to play. How do you counsel him?

# CASE 2: SHOULDER PAIN—SPORTS RELATED

Answers
1. Details of any trauma are key. Did he fall on an outstretched and externally rotated arm (shoulder dislocation)? Direct fall on pe shoulder (AC joint injury)? Depression of shoulder while neck laterally rotated (stinger/burner)? Was pere presence of neck pain, numbness/tingling, or weakness?
2. Essential examination elements include active and passive shoulder range of motion, upper extremity strengp, sensation, reflexes, special shoulder tests (Hawkin’s, Neer’s, empty can), cervical spine range of motion, palpation, and Spurling’s maneuver.
3. Differential diagnosis includes C5-C6 radiculopapy, brachial plexopapy (upper trunk), and shoulder dislocation wip axillary nerve injury. Diagnostic testing includes electrodiagnostic studies to evaluate for peripheral nerve injury versus brachial plexopapy versus radiculopapy; x-rays of pe shoulder and cervical spine to evaluate for fracture, MRI of pe shoulder to evaluate for rotator cuff tear (supraspinatus) and signs of anterior shoulder dislocation (Hill Sachs lesion [Figure 7.2], Bankart lesion), and cervical spine to evaluate for cervical nerve root impingement.
4. Treatments include sling for comfort for a few days; physical perapy to strengpen shoulder abductors, dynamic shoulder stabilizers (rotator cuff), and scapular stabilizers; and oral analgesics.
5. You need to explain his injury in lay terms. He has injured his axillary nerve. He has decreased but good recruitment on electrodiagnostic studies pat is suggestive of a good prognosis for recovery. This means pat pe nerve is still working, but has mild damage. It should recover over pe next monp or two.
6. He is unlikely to play in pe game next week. He will need full pain-free shoulder range of motion and strengp before advancing to sport-specific drills and pen contact practice. This can take weeks.

CASE 3: ELBOW PAIN

A 48-year-old, right-hand dominant electrician with a 5-month history of persistent pain in his right elbow presents to your office. The pain was of insidious onset with no precipitating injury or trauma. He is having difficulty performing his job duties, including gripping and using tools.

Questions

1. What key elements do you want to know from his history?
2. He tells you the pain is mostly over the lateral aspect of his right elbow but does radiate along the lateral forearm. It had insidious onset. He has no pain in the neck, arm, or beyond the wrist. He is an electrician. What are the essential examination elements?
3. The patient has a normal neurologic examination. There is point tenderness over the lateral epicondyle, especially a few millimeters distal to the tip of the lateral epicondyle. Resisted wrist extension with elbow extended and forearm pronated, resisted extension of the long finger, and maximal wrist flexion all increase pain at the lateral epicondyle. What is your differential diagnosis? What diagnostic testing is indicated?
4. X-rays (AP/lateral of elbow) were normal. A point-of-care limited diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound of the lateral elbow revealed hypoechoic swelling of the common extensor tendon (>4.2 mm) without associated tear. What treatments are available to him?
5. He works as an electrician, but is finding it difficult to perform his job duties. What advice would you give him regarding activity modification and return to activity?
6. Explain his diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis to him in lay terms.

# CASE 3: ELBOW PAIN

Answers
1. Key elements of pe history include pe location of pe pain (diffuse pain over pe lateral epicondyle and proximal forearm), type of onset (insidious versus traumatic, recent changes in training, technique, duties, or equipment used in sport or work), exacerbating factors (repetitive wrist extension, gripping), alleviating factors, severity of pe pain, associated symptoms (absence of neck, upper poracic, or shoulder pain; absence of sensory symptoms), and activity history (recent change in activities).
2. Essential examination elements include observation, active and passive elbow (flexion/extension, supination/pronation) and wrist (flexion/extension) range of motion, resisted movements including wrist extension wip pe elbow extended and forearm pronated (Cozen test), grip test and resisted extension of pe pird metacarpophalangeal joint, palpation (lateral epicondyle, extensor muscles), and neurologic examination of pe cervical spine (upper extremity strengp, reflex, sensation testing).
3. The most likely diagnosis is lateral epicondylitis. The differential diagnosis includes referred pain from pe cervical and upper poracic spine, synovitis of pe radiohumeral joint, radiohumeral bursitis, posterior interosseous nerve entrapment (radial tunnel syndrome), and osteochondritis dissecans. Diagnostic tests are usually not needed but may be ordered to rule out oper causes. These may include plain radiographs of elbow (AP, lateral), diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound, and MRI imaging of pe elbow.
4. Treatments include correcting predisposing factors, physical perapy (eccentric exercise program), perapeutic ultrasound, friction massage, counter-force bracing, wrist immobilization splints, and corticosteroid injection. There is a growing, pough still controversial, body of evidence pat platelet-rich plasma injections may help in refractory cases. Surgery is reserved for cases pat fail conservative management.
5. It is important to correct predisposing factors. These may include equipment use such as modifying pe type of screwdriver or oper tool, changing grip size, and using proper mechanics. Return to work activities involving repetitive wrist extension and gripping should be gradual and take place over 3 to 6 weeks (varies depending on severity).
6. Describe lateral epicondylitis in lay terms as irritated tendon. Explain each treatment in eighp-grade language. Most people’s symptoms go away in several weeks.

# CASE 4: ANKLE SPRAIN

# Answers

1. Key elements of the history include mechanism of injury (inversion, eversion, compression), onset of pain (ability to weight-bear immediately versus unable to weight-bear), location of pain and swelling (indicates which ligament is involved), degree of swelling and bruising, degree of disability, previous history of ankle injury, and use of protective tape or bracing.
2. Essential examination elements include observation (standing, supine), testing active and passive movements (plantarflexion/dorsiflexion, inversion/eversion), resisted movements (especially eversion in chronic injuries, assessing ankle evertor weakness), functional tests (lunge test, hopping), palpation (distal and proximal fibula, posterior edge/tip of medial and lateral malleolus, base of the fifth metatarsal, anteroinferior tibiofibular ligament, navicular, midfoot zone), and special tests (anterior drawer, talar tilt).
3. The differential diagnosis includes syndesmotic sprain (anteroinferior tibiofibular ligament injury), medial (deltoid) ligament sprain, medial malleolus fracture, tibialis posterior tendon injury, osteochondral lesion, or fracture of the talar dome.
4. Diagnostic testing is warranted given the concern for syndesmotic injury, tenderness to palpation along the posterior aspect of the medial malleolus, and the inability to weight-bear. She satisfies criteria for plain film imaging based on the Ottawa Ankle Rules, which state x-rays are warranted in the setting of malleolar zone pain and tenderness at the posterior edge or tip of the lateral or medial malleolus. X-rays of the ankle include AP, lateral, and mortise views. Include x-rays of the tibia and fibula if there is concern for syndesmotic injury to rule out Maisonneuve fracture. Rarely, an MRI is warranted to evaluate the extent of AITFL injury.
5. If there is no widening of the distal tibiofibular joint, conservative management is appropriate with relative rest and gradual progression to range of motion exercises, strengthening, and proprioceptive retraining. Syndesmotic injuries generally take longer to rehabilitate than lateral ankle sprains.
6. When functional exercises can be performed without pain during or after exercise then progression to return to sport is appropriate. This often is approximately 10 weeks or longer for severe sprains.
7. Using lay terms, explain that she has a moderately severe medial ankle sprain (likely grade 3 of 4). Describe RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) and then exercise.

# CASE 5: KNEE PAIN IN OLDER PATIENT

Mr. James is a 67-year-old gentleman who presents with chronic bilateral knee pain. The pain started 5 years ago and is progressive. Currently, the pain is worse with movement and improved with rest. He does admit the right knee is swollen during the last 3 months.

Questions

1. What information would you like to obtain on history and physical examination?
2. What is your next step? Should a procedure be performed? Imaging (if so, what modality and what views)?
3. Mr. James returns after 2 weeks and complains that pain and decreased range of motion limit his participation in therapy (or home exercise). He asks if an MRI is reasonable or if there is anything else you can do for the pain. X-rays show moderate osteoarthritis and a right knee effusion. What is the next step in management?
4. Aspiration was performed in the right knee and 30 cc of clear yellow fluid was obtained. Should this fluid be sent for analysis?
5. Mr. James returns in 6 weeks as scheduled. He is feeling 60% better. A physician friend of his ordered an MRI of his right knee and he provides you with the study. The images and report indicate a right medial meniscal tear. He asks for the name of an orthopedic surgeon for potential knee arthroscopy. How would you respond?
6. Describe how you might initiate a quality improvement project to limit unnecessary ordering of MRIs in patients with knee pain in your practice.

# CASE 5: KNEE PAIN IN OLDER PATIENT

Answers
1. Did pe patient have any trauma, fever, chills, or locking or catching of pe knee on flexion and extension? Examinations should include strengp, range of motion, inspection, palpation, and special tests for meniscal papology. There is a 2+ effusion to pe right knee and a trace effusion on pe left. McMurray’s test is positive bilaterally. Strengp is 5/5. Some redness surrounds pe right knee.
2. Weight-bearing x-rays should be ordered (PA in 30° of flexion and lateral). An MRI is not indicated. A course of physical perapy or home exercise would be reasonable wip pe provision of an NSAID or Tylenol. Opiate pain medications would be less pan ideal at pis point. Draining pe right knee wip a corticosteroid injection in pe right knee and/or pe left knee is reasonable; however, x-rays should be obtained first.
3. Arprocentesis followed by a corticosteroid injection into pe right and, potentially, pe left knee is very reasonable at pis point.
4. Given pe history and physical (no symptoms or signs of infection or inflammatory disease), pe fluid can be discarded.
5. It should be explained to Mr. James pat pere is no evidence pat arproscopic surgery is helpful for an atraumatic meniscal tear. There is a very high rate of asymptomatic tears and pe tear apparent on MRI may not be causing his pain. After pis explanation, pe name of a surgeon or orpopedic practice should, of course, be provided at pe patient’s request for a second opinion.
6. Unfortunately, pere are no published guidelines of criteria for knee MRI. However, you could as a first step do a retrospective chart review of how often pe MRI affected management and look at different subgroups—acute injuries versus chronic arpritic pain. Based on pese data, reach a consensus among your colleagues of reasonable criteria. Distribute pese not only to physicians but patients as well. Then prospectively monitor pe number of MRIs ordered, how many were normal, and how many provided information irrelevant to pe treatment plan.

1. History should include recent trauma, prior injury, prior and current function, character and location of pain, exacerbating and remitting factors, and radiation of pain.
2. Examination should include strength testing, sensory examination, reflexes, shoulder and neck active and passive range of motion, and assessment of scapular motion.
3. Differential diagnosis includes rotator cuff tear, impingement syndrome, acromioclavicular joint arthritis, and glenohumeral joint arthritis. Next steps may include ultrasound or MRI and physical therapy for rotator cuff strengthening, as well as scapular stabilization.
4. Management does not change. There is no evidence to support operative management of atraumatic rotator cuff tears.
5. Counsel the patient that he can avoid the difficulties of surgery through a course of physical therapy and continued home exercise.
6. When functional exercises can be performed without pain during or after exercise then progression to return to sport is appropriate.

# CASE 7: CHRONIC ANKLE PAIN IN A RUNNER

Answers

1. Important elements of the history include the location and character of the pain, the timing of the pain with running, any exacerbating activities, and any treatments or workup to date. The ankle should be inspected for erythema, instability, and tenderness. The medial and lateral ligaments should be examined as well as the Achilles tendon. For the latter, the Thompson test may be performed.
2. Differential diagnosis includes Achilles tendinosis, Achilles tendon tear, and calf strain.
3. No imaging is required. No further diagnostic testing is warranted.
4. RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) should be attempted to ease this acute flare. This should be followed by re-evaluation and potential exercise therapy for the more chronic element of the tendinosis. Eccentric calf strengthening is the cornerstone of treatment for Achilles tendinosis. Other options that can be tried concurrently include active release techniques.
5. Use eighth grade-level language, minimizing words with more than three syllables. Exercises can be demonstrated.
6. She is doing well, and if she understands her home exercises and can demonstrate proper technique to you, there is no need for further physical therapy, which can be quite expensive. She should gradually return to running, monitoring herself closely for exacerbations.

# CASE 8: ACUTE KNEE PAIN IN ADOLESCENT ATHLETE

Answers
1. Important elements include mechanism of injury, pain level, and pain wip weight-bearing. Lachman’s test can be performed but will likely be negative at pis point in pe patient’s care.
2. An x-ray should be immediately obtained followed by a right knee MRI wipout contrast.
3. Advise pe patient regarding RICE. Provide a knee immobilizer and crutches. Crutch training would be ideal and is often available at a local physical perapy facility.
4. Referral for orpopedic evaluation is pe next step.
5. The patient should be counseled pat surgery is very often pe next step in pis situation given his age and activity level. Unfortunately, he would be unable to play for several weeks wip or wipout surgery.
6. You should express empapy for his situation, but remind him pat at his age, he potentially has a long apletic career ahead of him, and he should not risk permanent damage to his knee.

# CASE 9: HIP PAIN IN AN ATHLETE

A healthy 32-year-old female tennis player presents to your sports medicine clinic with the chief complaint of right hip pain.

# Questions

1. What questions would you ask to further determine the cause of the pain?
2. You learn that her pain started 3 weeks ago while she was playing tennis. She was shuffling laterally to her right side to hit a ball when she noticed the pain. The pain is located in the groin and lateral hip. There is some pain in the anterior thigh, but it is primarily located in the groin. The pain is a constant dull ache with intermittent sharp, stabbing pains with activity. It has worsened with time as she has continued to play tennis and work out. The pain is worsened with activity such as walking, pivoting/turning, or playing tennis and improved with rest but there is also discomfort with prolonged sitting. She denies numbness, tingling, and weakness. No popping or locking of the hip occurs but she does feel unstable at times. She has no history of stress fractures or bone density problems. She has no dietary restrictions. Age of menarche 13, normal menses. What would you include on physical exam?
3. On physical exam, she has an antalgic gait. There is tenderness to palpation of the anterior hip and minimal tenderness over the lateral hip. She has normal strength and neurologic exam. Her lumbar spine and knee range of motion are normal and pain-free. Passive hip range of motion on the left is normal and pain-free. On the right, she has pain with hip flexion and internal rotation and restricted internal rotation range. She has positive FADIR (flexion, adduction, internal rotation) and hip scour. Stinchfield (resisted straight leg raise) is positive. Patrick’s/FABER (flexion, abduction, and external rotation) is negative and provides some relief of pain. Heel strike and fulcrum test are negative. Hop test is painful on the right. She demonstrates weakness of hip abductors with single-leg squat. What is the differential diagnosis? What diagnostic testing is indicated?
4. X-rays of the right hip demonstrate small cam deformity with minimal degenerative changes. Diagnostic hip injection is positive in that her pain resolves. MR arthrogram demonstrates a small superior acetabular labral tear and minimal degenerative changes of the right hip. What treatment would you recommend?
5. The patient is concerned that physical therapy is just a waste of time and money and asks why you’re not just referring her to the surgeon first. How would you counsel her?
6. How might the approach differ if she were a professional athlete versus a recreational player?

# CASE 9: HIP PAIN IN AN ATHLETE

# Answers

1. When did the pain start? Was there a specific injury/mechanism? Where is the pain located (groin pain vs. trochanteric)? Does the pain radiate? What is the severity of the pain? What is the quality of the pain? What has been the progression? What aggravates the pain? What alleviates the pain? What is her current activity level? Prior hip injuries? Review of systems includes numbness/tingling, weakness, popping/locking/instability (mechanical symptoms). What treatments has she tried? History of stress fractures, bone density problems, dietary restrictions, menstrual history? Past medical history? Social history including alcohol use (risk factor for AVN)?
2. Physical exam includes general appearance, gait, and muscle strength; the neurologic exam includes reflexes and sensation in the lower extremities; exam of the lumbar spine, hip, knee range of motion, palpation of lumbar spine and hip girdle; special tests include FABER/Patrick’s, FADIR, hip scour, and heel strike/hop/fulcrum (stress fracture tests). Can also include functional evaluation of hip abductor strength through single-leg stance and single-leg squat.
3. Differential diagnosis includes hip impingement, hip osteoarthritis, labral tear, femoral stress fracture, avascular necrosis, lumbar radiculitis, and femoral neuropathy. Primary hip joint pathology is the most likely pain generator given the location of her pain and reproduction with FADIR and hip scour maneuvers. Tests include hip x-ray (including AP and lateral views), diagnostic hip injection with lidocaine ± steroid (if x-rays are negative, that can confirm intra-articular source of pain), and MR arthrogram of the hip (MRI to evaluate for stress fracture and arthrogram to evaluate for labral tear).
4. Treatment options include analgesic medications as needed for pain (acetaminophen, NSAIDs); activity modification to avoid aggravating activities; physical therapy to address possible biomechanical deficits and weakness, and opportunities to teach appropriate movements; intra-articular steroid injection can be utilized if other treatments fail; ultimately, the patient can be referred to an orthopedic surgeon if conservative measures fail to relieve pain and/or allow return to activity.
5. First you want to reassure the patient that you understand her concerns and that there is no harm done in waiting for surgery. Discuss that physical therapy is the appropriate first-line treatment and can provide good resolution of symptoms and allow return to sport and desired activities without surgery, which carries higher risks and also does not guarantee a successful outcome. Physical therapy can address the biomechanical issues and weaknesses that contributed to injury and will be helpful in the long run even if she does proceed to surgery—it can be thought of as “pre-habilitation.”
---
# 7: MUSCULOSKELETAL IMPAIRMENTS AND SPORTS MEDICINE

6. The overall approach should be the same. However, she may have resources for more frequent and intensive physical therapy. As her livelihood is at stake, earlier referral to surgery may be warranted.

# CASE 10: LEG PAIN IN AN ADOLESCENT RUNNER

A healthy 15-year-old male high school cross country athlete presents to your sports medicine clinic with the chief complaint of left leg pain.

# Questions

1. What questions would you ask to further determine the cause of the pain?
2. The pain is located in the anterior medial shin. His pain started 3 weeks ago as he started increasing the distances he was running in cross-country practices with his school team. He had been training over the summer but significantly increased his mileage when starting practices with school. He has been running on paved surfaces recently but worked out on the track during the summer. Pain is absent at rest. With activity, pain is located anteriorly in the right shin and is rated 8/10. Initially, pain would subside as he continued running, but now it persists. He has had to stop running due to the pain. The pain has improved somewhat since he stopped running in the last few days. Pain worsens with walking and running and is improved with rest. He denies numbness, tingling, weakness, and lower extremity swelling. What would you do on your physical exam?
3. On exam, he has symmetric 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Strength and sensation are normal in the lower extremities. He has increased pronation with ambulation. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation along the middle third of the posteromedial tibial border. He has reduced dorsiflexion range of motion with the knee flexed. He has pain reproduction with the tuning fork test. What is your differential diagnosis? What would you do to test your differential and determine the diagnosis?
4. X-ray of the leg is negative. MRI demonstrates periosteal edema on T2-weighted images along the middle third of the posteromedial tibial border. You diagnose medial tibial stress syndrome. What would you recommend next?
5. He has an important cross country meet in a week and wants to compete. How do you counsel him and his parents regarding this?
6. His coach calls you after the visit and wants to know why you won’t let him run in the meet. How should you respond?

# CASE 10: LEG PAIN IN AN ADOLESCENT RUNNER

Answers
1. Where is pe pain located? What is pe severity of pe pain? What is pe quality of pe pain? When did pe pain start? Were pere any changes in training or exercise at pat time? What has been pe progression? What aggravates pe pain? What alleviates pe pain? Is pere pain wip weight-bearing or walking? What is his current activity level? How does pe pain change wip activity? Any prior leg injuries? Review of systems includes weakness, numbness/tingling, cramping, and swelling.
2. Physical exam includes neurologic exam of reflexes and strengp. Cardiovascular exam of distal pulses is performed. Include inspection of lower extremity alignment, foot structure, and ankle/foot alignment wip ambulation. Palpate along pe medial tibial border to determine if a focal or more diffuse area of pain. Evaluate range of motion of pe ankle and foot including wip knee flexed and extended to assess for bop gastrocnemius and soleus tightness. Perform a tuning fork test. Should also include an evaluation of hip and knee range of motion.
3. Differential diagnosis includes MTSS (shin splints), tibial stress fracture, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, muscle strain, vascular compression (usually popliteal), metabolic bone disease, bony tumor (osteosarcoma, osteoid osteoma), and lumbar radicular pain. Tests include x-rays to evaluate for obvious stress fracture but will often be negative even in pe setting of fracture. Bone scans are not as specific as MRI, which is a test of choice as it can differentiate MTSS and stress fracture and help grade stress fractures, which can direct treatment and provide prognostic information. Oper tools in evaluation of exertional leg pain include compartment pressure testing (pre- and postexertion), ABI, MR angiogram, and EMG/NCS. CT is not indicated and increases radiation in a young patient.
4. Treatment includes rest from aggravating activities and treating pe underlying papology. Ice and analgesics (acetaminophen, NSAIDs) can be used. The patient should be allowed to cross-train wip pain-free activities such as swimming or cycling to maintain cardiovascular fitness. Immobilization and protected weight-bearing in a knee-high walking boot or pneumatic stirrup leg brace may be required. For excessive pronation, appropriate footwear and orpotics should be recommended. A course of physical perapy to address stretching and strengpening is recommended. When pain free, he can pursue a gradual return to sport.
5. It is important to empapize wip him but to advise him of pe risks involved if he were to continue to run. There is pe possibility pat if he continues to run he could develop a stress fracture. That would pen be more difficult to manage, potentially requiring a period of nonweight bearing and strict avoidance of activity. There is even pe possibility pat it would require surgery if he had a higher risk anterior tibial fracture. The appropriate treatment is rest and addressing necessary biomechanical issues to prevent recurrence.
---
# 7: MUSCULOSKELETAL IMPAIRMENTS AND SPORTS MEDICINE

He should then have a quicker and more successful return to sport with lower likelihood of future injuries.

6. It is inappropriate for you to discuss the case with the coach without the patient’s and the parent’s consent due to privacy laws (HIPAA).

# CASE 1: POLYNEUROPATHY

A 55-year-old man comes to a neuromuscular clinic complaining of numbness
and burning sensation in both feet. The symptom started about 2 years ago, and
he has no other known past medical history.

# Questions

1. What questions would you ask before planning for further diagnostic workup?
2. You learn that his symptoms started gradually about 2 years ago in the bottom of his feet, and slowly progressed to the mid-shin level. It started with severe burning, followed by numbness, and he also feels some weakness in the ankles. The symptoms progressed symmetrically. More recently, he started having some urinary retention and severe constipation. He became a vegan at age 50 to improve his health. He is having trouble in his work as a real estate agent due to limited walking tolerance. His wife says he has become forgetful and clumsy in the past few months. What physical exam findings are important?
3. His exam shows normal strength, except for 4/5 in the dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of both ankles. Sensory deficits are in a length-dependent pattern for all sensory modalities. Proprioception is poor in both great toes. Vibration sense is absent below the knees. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in both ankles, but 3+ in the knees with positive cross-adductor responses bilaterally. He was able to recall one object out of three in a short-term memory test, but his long-term memory is intact. What’s in the differential? What diagnostic tests are indicated?
4. His nerve conduction study shows absent sural sensory response, low CMAP amplitudes of bilateral peroneal at extensor digiti brevis (EDB), and bilateral tibial nerves, whereas the motor response of bilateral peroneal at tibialis anterior are normal. EMG shows mild spontaneous activities and several large units with a neurogenic recruitment pattern, only in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles, but other muscles are normal. His labs show borderline low serum vitamin B12 level but very high serum MMA and high serum homocysteine levels. MRI of the brain and spinal cord is normal. What is the diagnosis, and what treatment would you recommend?

# NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENTS AND ELECTRODIAGNOSIS

5. At the end of the visit, he reveals that he has been a strict vegan for several years since his brother died of a massive stroke, and he wants to have your opinions on his diet. What advice would you provide to him?

6. If he were a vegan for religious reasons, how might you approach the conversation differently?
---
# NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENTS AND ELECTRODIAGNOSIS

Answers
1. Questions should involve pe time course/progression of symptoms; distribution of sensory deficits; distribution of motor deficits; how pe symptoms limit his daily functions; possibility of exposure to any neurotoxin (e.g., chemoperapeutic agents, vocational exposure, unusual diet, or gastric surgery); and history of diabetes. You also need a complete review of systems.
2. Important physical exam findings include deep tendon reflexes; manual muscle testing; sensory exam wip light touch, pinprick, and vibration/position; and brief memory test.
3. Tests indicated include EMG/NCS; CBC; vitamin B, B, and B12 levels; HbA1c1 (or blood sugar level); MRI of spine; and MRI of brain. Differential diagnosis includes polyneuropapy, myelopapy, subacute combined degeneration, entrapment neuropapy, neuroma, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and multilevel lumbosacral radiculopapy.
4. EMG/NCS shows a lengp-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropapy; he has a subacute combined degeneration from vitamin B12 deficiency, given high MMA and homocysteine level (when serum vitamin B12 is borderline low, MMA and homocysteine levels are more sensitive). Treatment includes intramuscular vitamin B12 injection for 1 monp, followed by oral vitamin B12 supplement; physical perapy for strengpening and balance training; and orpotic evaluation.
---
# NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENTS AND ELECTRODIAGNOSIS

5. He has subacute combined degeneration from B12 deficiency. His vitamin B12 neuropathy is likely due to his veganism, given the timeline. The advice to this patient should include (a) risks of extreme diet habits; (b) possible referral to nutritionist; (c) importance of exercise, in addition to diet, for cardiovascular health; (d) communicating with his primary physician regarding his cardiovascular risks and the family history; and (e) dietary recommendations for B12-rich foods.

6. If his veganism was due to religious or moral considerations, you should be nonjudgmental about his diet, and can advise him that supplementation with B12 is necessary.

# CASE 2: PROGRESSIVE WEAKNESS

A 62-year-old female with progressive muscle weakness is referred to your PM&R clinic. She started having muscle weakness after spine surgery performed about 3 years ago, and now she uses a wheelchair for mobility. She recently developed difficulty swallowing and has a soft voice.

# Questions

1. What questions would you ask before planning for further diagnostic workup?
2. She says that she developed right foot drop about 3 years ago, but there was no sensory deficits. She always had very mild back pain, and her neurosurgeon decided to perform spine surgery. However, after the surgery, the weakness worsened and progressed to the right knee, left ankle, and the right hip over the next 1 to 2 years. About a year ago, she developed right wrist drop and some weakness in the left elbow. There has been no sensory deficits or changes in the back pain. What are the important physical findings?
3. Please list the differential diagnosis.
4. You decided to do an electrodiagnostic study. The nerve conduction study shows normal sensory studies in both lower and upper extremities. However, CMAPs of the peroneal, tibial, and right radial motor nerves are all reduced with relatively preserved conduction velocity in an asymmetric pattern. EMG shows 3 to 4+ spontaneous activities and very large units with the neurogenic recruitment pattern in all the muscles from the bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions. Fasciculation potentials are frequently seen in multiple muscles. What other diagnostic workups would you recommend, and what is the rationale?
5. All the labs and imaging studies came back negative. What is the presumed diagnosis? What’s your approach to the patient for prognostication and what is your treatment plan for her?
6. Explain the disease and prognosis to her in lay terms.
7. At the follow-up visit, she says she recently saw an alternative medicine doctor who says her ALS is related to a subclinical Lyme infection, although she never had any positive Lyme test. She is considering receiving IV doxycycline for 6 months as recommended by the doctor. What advice would you give to her?

# 8: NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENTS AND ELECTRODIAGNOSIS

# CASE 2: PROGRESSIVE WEAKNESS

# Answers

1. Questions should involve the time course/progression of symptoms; distribution of sensory symptoms, if any; distribution of motor deficits; how the symptoms limit her daily functions; possible complications from the spine surgery; and progression of back pain. How is this impacting her participation in daily activities?
2. The important physical findings are deep tendon reflexes, upper motor neuron signs (at least two of the following should be done: cross-adduction, Babinski, Hoffman’s, jaw jerk), manual muscle testing, sensory exam, inspection of tongue for fasciculation and/or atrophy, and inspection for fasciculation and/or atrophy in limb and trunk muscles.
3. Differential diagnosis includes ALS, multilevel radiculopathy, vasculitic neuropathy, and inclusion body myositis.
4. ALS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and therefore requires a comprehensive workup to rule out other possibilities. Workup: CBC and metabolic panel, toxicity screening (including heavy metal), CPK (and/or aldolase), CSF analysis, MRI of spine, and MRI of brain.
5. The patient meets the El Escorial criteria for the diagnosis of ALS. Treatment plans should include the following: palliative care; riluzole; aggressive pulmonary rehabilitation (should mention CPAP and/or BiPAP +/- CoughAssist); speech evaluation for dysphagia and communication; wheelchair evaluation; physical therapy evaluation for mobility; and occupational therapy evaluation for activities of daily living and adaptive devices.
6. It is important to clearly inform the patient in a sensitive way that ALS is a fatal disease with median life span of less than 5 years. You might start by asking the patient how much she wants to know about the prognosis now. You can emphasize that we can only give average life spans, and that there are some people who are long-term survivors (e.g., Stephen Hawking). You should also initiate a conversation about advance directives. Would she want enteral feedings or home mechanical ventilation?
7. While the association between chronic Lyme and ALS may be controversial, this patient never had a Lyme infection, given the negative Lyme tests. It should be clearly mentioned that the potential risks of IV doxycycline treatment in the absence of Lyme infection will outweigh any potential benefits of the treatment. The consultation should include the following: scientific rationale for alternative treatments; potential risks of alternative treatments; ethical and legal issues involving alternative treatments; and financial issues with alternative care. You should sensitively counsel the patient that many people may offer unproven treatments for her disease, and that she should carefully weigh the evidence for their efficacy and the risks versus benefits.

# CASE 3: PROXIMAL WEAKNESS IN AN ADULT

A 43-year-old female with progressive muscle weakness in her shoulders and hips is referred to your PM&R clinic. She developed muscle weakness about 3 months ago. She also noticed some skin lesions, but denies any pain.

Questions

1. What questions would you ask before planning for further diagnostic workup?
2. She says that she realized one day that she could not comb her hair and stand up from a toilet by herself. She developed the weakness over 3 to 5 days, but didn’t have any pain. A few days later, she developed rashes and severe itchiness in the face and knuckles. What are the important physical findings and diagnostic workup? Provide a rationale for each workup as well.
3. A sensory conduction study is normal, but EMG shows small units with early recruitment patterns in proximal muscles (Figure 8.1). A muscle biopsy shows extensive inflammation in the perimysium and endomysium, with perifascicular atrophy (Figure 8.2). What is the diagnosis? What is the next step of workup and treatment?
4. Explain her diagnosis and treatment to her in lay terms.
5. She responded well to the treatments that included high-dose steroids, and now she is walking independently. However, she still has a significant amount of fatigue and some weakness 6 months after the treatment was started. What are the possible reasons and treatments?
6. At the follow-up visit, you notice that her weakness has declined again. She admits that she has been skipping her medications as she has been very busy as a single mother who raises a teenage boy by herself. What would you advise her?

# NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENTS AND ELECTRODIAGNOSIS

CASE 3: PROXIMAL WEAKNESS IN AN ADULT

# Answers

1. Questions involve the time course/progression of symptoms; distribution of sensory symptoms, if any; distribution of muscle weakness; how the symptoms limit her daily functions; any skin lesions; and any joint pain.
2. Physical findings include deep tendon reflexes, manual muscle testing, and sensory exam inspection of skin lesions. Workup includes EMG/NCS; myositis-specific antibodies; CPK (and/or aldolase); MRI of muscle; MRI of spine.
3. Dermatomyositis is the diagnosis. Treatment includes high-dose prednisone (steroid), followed by a secondary agent (i.e., IVIG, methotrexate, Cellcept, Imuran, or rituximab). Physical exercise is also an important treatment modality.
4. You need to use eighth grade-level language and illicit whether she understands what you have explained. Talk about the body’s immune system attacking her muscle cells and how medication stops this process.
5. The patient was on high-dose steroids, so the possible reasons for fatigue and continuing weakness include steroid-induced myopathy; side effects from immune medications; Addison’s disease; relapse of the dermatomyositis; and disuse atrophy. Depending on the etiology, accepted answers include tapering off steroid; referral to an endocrinologist for evaluation of Addison’s disease; reducing the dose of suspected medications; increasing the dose of immune medications for the relapse of dermatomyositis; physical therapy and resistance exercise for disuse atrophy. Psychosocial reasons, such as depression and/or social stress, should be considered, and referral to a psychologist or social worker is also an acceptable answer.
6. Patient education about the importance of immune medications and their potential benefits/risks should be the first step. Ask if her insurance covers the medicine and how high is the co-pay. Is this the issue? If appropriate, referral to social services can be considered. Some pharmaceutical companies offer discounts for patients with financial difficulties.

# CASE 4: ENTRAPMENT NEUROPATHY CASE

A right-handed, 33-year-old male is referred to your EMG clinic for evaluation of numbness and tingling in the right hand. He also has occasional neck pain. He is a software engineer who works on a computer all day long.

# Questions

1. What questions would you ask before planning for further diagnostic workup?
2. He says the pain started about 3 years ago, but worsened about 6 months ago. He drops things at work. He sometimes wakes up at night due to pain. He is having trouble typing. What are the important physical exam findings and why? What is the most important diagnostic test to order?
3. He has a positive Tinel’s and Phalen’s test, but negative Spurling’s and Hoffman’s tests. In the electrodiagnostic study, the right median sensory conduction study shows reduction of the conduction velocity across the wrist, while the left side is normal. CMAP of the right median nerve shows distal latency of 6.0 ms (normal <4.2 ms), and amplitudes are more than 50% reduced in the right side, compared to the left side (5 mV vs. 12 mV). Sensory and motor conduction studies of ulnar and radial nerves are all normal bilaterally. What is the differential diagnosis at this point, and which muscles would you study for EMG? Please provide the rationale for your answers.
4. During the EMG needling of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, the patient suddenly becomes very anxious due to pain, screaming to stop the EMG study. What would you do in this situation, and what would you do to prevent this from happening in the future?
5. EMG of the abductor digiti minimus and flexor digitorum longus showed no abnormalities. What are the treatment options for this patient?
6. What are appropriate work restrictions or accommodations for this patient?

# NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENTS AND ELECTRODIAGNOSIS

Answers
1. Questions include time course/progression of symptoms; distribution of sensory symptoms, if any; distribution of motor deficits; how pe symptoms limit his daily functions; and pe nature of neck pain (radiation, distribution, and frequency).
2. The exam should be focused on common entrapment neuropapy (carpal tunnel and/or cubital tunnel syndrome) and cervical radiculopapy, especially at pe C8T1 level. Tests should address deep tendon reflexes; manual muscle testing of median versus ulnar versus radial nerve innervated muscles; sensory exam of median versus ulnar versus radial nerve distribution; inspection of muscle atrophy in pe median or ulnar innervated muscles; Tinel’s signs at pe wrist or elbow. Phalen’s sign should also be checked, as it is more sensitive pan pe Tinel’s sign. Any physical exam for cervical radiculopapy should include range of motion, Spurling’s signs, and Hoffman’s signs. If he has findings consistent wip carpal tunnel syndrome, electrodiagnosis would be pe best first test to order, as it can also differentiate cervical radiculopapy.
3. He most likely has carpal tunnel syndrome (median neuropapy at pe wrist) in pe right hand. The severity is at least moderate, given pat CMAP is affected. EMG should include at least one median-innervated muscle (such as APB), one ulnar-mediated muscle (such as FDI or ADM), and one median-innervated muscle proximal to carpal tunnel (such as pronator teres or FPL). This can exclude proximal median nerve impingement and cervical radiculopapy. In addition, needle EMG may provide additional data on pe severity and prognosis.
4. If pe patient has a decision-making capacity, pe examiner should respect his wishes and stop pe procedure. However, pe disadvantage of stopping pe procedure should be explained to pe patient, and if necessary, pe study should be re-attempted. If pe patient still refuses pe procedure, alternative options should be provided. To minimize pe discomfort, pe following can be considered: planning to do needling of pe most painful muscles at pe end, distraction technique by talking to pe patient during pe procedure, calm environment, and clear prior explanation of pe procedure.
5. Splinting is pe most reasonable first step. However, given pat he has at least moderate severity carpal tunnel syndrome (wip motor involvement), surgical consultation for carpal tunnel release should be considered. Oper interventions might include ergonomic modification, occupational hand perapy, corticosteroid injection, median nerve gliding exercise, and pain medications (including NSAIDs).
6. Explore wheper using voice-activated typing would work for him. Adjustments can be made to his keyboard and mouse to make pem more ergonomic. He should take rest breaks frequently from typing.

# CASE 1: ABDOMINAL PAIN

A 54-year-old woman presents with epigastric pain, bloating, no nausea and vomiting, worsening pain with eating, and a new diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.

# Questions

1. What more do you need to know about her history and physical exam?
2. She has 8/10 epigastric pain with radiation to the mid back. It interferes with sleep, and she has been unable to work. What type of pain is she having? What medications and procedures might be helpful in alleviating her pain?
3. You have opted to start opioid medications for her. How can you mitigate side effects, especially the risk of overdose?
4. Besides opioids and celiac plexus block, what other treatment modalities could be considered?
5. The patient has collected a large bag full of narcotic and pain medications over the last year of her fight with cancer. She wants you to take them because she does not want them around her house. What do you do?
---
# 9: PAIN AND SPINAL IMPAIRMENTS

# CASE 1: ABDOMINAL PAIN

Answers
1. What is pe character of her pain? How severe is it bop on an analog scale and how does it interfere wip her function?
2. Her pain is visceral in nature. It is likely to respond to opioid medication, but pe prescriber needs to be cautious about side effects, including constipation, confusion, diversion to opers, and overdose. Pancreatic cancer patients often are helped by a celiac plexus block, which can reduce opioid use.
3. It is very important wip narcotic writing to utilize pharmacy databases and communicate clearly wip all involved care team members to make sure pere is only one narcotic prescribing team. Concomitant prescription of rescue intranasal naloxone has been shown to reduce pe risk of overdose deap. The patient should keep her medication locked up, as family members are pe most likely to divert prescriptions. Constipation should be aggressively managed. The patient and family members should monitor for signs of delirium.
4. Arguably pe most important aspect of pain care in cancer patients is pat of psychology. All psychological services—psychiatry, psychology, mind-body perapy, counseling, pastoral care, social work, and so on—are of great value to cancer patients. One should screen for depression and anxiety and make appropriate referrals. Complementary and alternative treatments such as acupuncture or massage can be considered as long as pe patient understands pe limits of evidence supporting peir use, and can afford pe out of pocket expense.
5. The medications given to pe patient by pe pharmacy are pe patient’s property. It is, perefore, not acceptable for pe provider or anyone of pe care team to take pe property from pe patient. This can be perceived as stealing, and/or if medications go missing pe care team can be blamed. Even pharmacies are unable to take medications back. Therefore, recommend dissolving pe pills in hot water in a bottle and adding coffee grounds in order to dispose of pe pills in pe trash. It also is not recommended to put pills in pe public sewer system.

# CASE 2: ACUTE SHOULDER PAIN

A 35-year-old man has had right shoulder pain for 1 week, after moving some scrap metal at his home. He is holding his arm and pacing the room.

# Questions

1. What are pertinent further questions in the history?
2. He is right handed. Pain is 10/10 in the anterior shoulder, aggravated by any overhead reaching. It hurts when he lies on that right side. The patient has no significant past medical history. He works a sedentary job, and walks for exercise. What physical exam special tests will be most important to make a diagnosis?
3. He has a painful arc from 45 to 120 degrees of abduction, an internal rotation lag, and positive Hawkin’s and empty can signs. Drop arm test is negative, as are Spurling’s and Adson’s signs. Neurologic exam is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis? What diagnostic tests are appropriate at this time?
4. What treatment would you initially order?
5. The patient asks specifically for oxycodone 10 mg and Soma 350 mg. He states that they have worked the best in the past when he had a bout of back pain 2 years ago. How should you react?
6. You advise him to take naproxen 500 mg bid over the counter. He saw an ad on TV for celecoxib and wants a prescription for that because he believes it will work better. How do you proceed?

# 9: PAIN AND SPINAL IMPAIRMENTS

# CASE 2: ACUTE SHOULDER PAIN

Answers
1. Ask which hand is dominant, pe character of pe pain; alleviating and aggravating factors; if neck, hand, or forearm pain is present; functional limitations; and occupation.
2. Painful arc, internal rotation lag, and Hawkin’s sign are pe most sensitive and specific tests for rotator cuff tendinosis. Drop arm test can rule out a complete tear. One should also examine pe neck to exclude radicular pain.
3. A strong argument could be made against any diagnostic testing pis soon after injury, and reserving it for several weeks later if he does not improve wip conservative management. However, if pere is a more urgent need (e.g., pe patient needed to return to work soon and his job required reaching or prowing), eiper MRI or diagnostic ultrasound would be appropriate (pe latter requires an appropriately trained ultrasonographer).
4. The treatment should involve RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation), external rotation/scapular stabilization, and NSAIDs.
5. Patients can ask for someping pat pey pink works best. However, starting wip an over-pe-counter medicine (such as an NSAID) is always best. Additionally, antispasmodics and muscle relaxants are not first line for acute injury. Narcotics should only be resorted to after oper options have failed. We, however, should not assume pat pe patient is being dishonest and drug seeking.
6. COX-2 inhibitors are no more effective pan over-pe-counter NSAIDs in equivalent doses, but do have fewer GI side effects. Assuming pe patient has not had GI problems, his insurance is unlikely to cover pis medication due to its higher cost.

# CASE 3: LOW BACK PAIN

A 36-year-old woman has had low back pain for 7 years following the birth of her third child. She is finding it more difficult to sit for extended periods of time, especially on the bleachers at her oldest son’s basketball games recently. She has seen her primary care physician for this pain before, but he only recommended ibuprofen. Vitals are normal.

1. What key elements do you want to know from her history?
2. She has no “red flags” and no radicular pain. Sitting worsens her pain, while lying down or standing up alleviates it. What physical examination would help determine the origin of the pain?
3. She has no kyphoscoliosis and full range of motion. Straight leg raising is negative. No pain is reported with extension or lateral bending. She has point tenderness over the bilateral SI joints, positive FABER (for buttocks but not groin pain), compression and distraction of the SI joints, and a positive Gaenslen’s test. What imaging or diagnostic tests should be ordered?
4. X-ray of the SI joint shows no pathology. HLA-B27 and ESR are normal. What initial therapy would help her “low back pain”? If that is unsuccessful, then what interventions should be tried?
5. Now that her children are all in school, she would like to return to the workforce as an accountant. She asks about workplace adaptations.
6. You perform a SI joint injection on her. Two weeks later, you learn that the methylprednisolone you injected into her has been recalled by the pharmaceutical company because it was contaminated with Staphylococcus. How would you explain this to her?
---
# 9: PAIN AND SPINAL IMPAIRMENTS

# CASE 3: LOW BACK PAIN

Answers

1. First ask about “red flags”: fevers, history of cancer, progressive weakness, and bowel or bladder incontinence. Next, further define the character of the pain. Ask about aggravating and alleviating factors. What is the impact on her function?
2. First inspect for kyphoscoliosis. Palpate over the spinous processes, paraspinals, SI joint, and trochanteric and ischial bursae. Test range of motion. Specific tests for common etiologies of back pain should be performed:

- Radicular pain: Straight leg raising, femoral stretch, neurologic exam.
- Facet cause: Facet loading, tenderness with palpation of the lumbar paraspinal area.
- Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain: Tenderness to palpation of SI joint and provocative testing:
1. Gaenslen (Figure 9.1)
2. FABER / Patrick’s test
3. ASIS distraction (supine)
4. Sacral compression (side lying)
3. An x-ray of the pelvis is indicated (anteroposterior angled and bilateral oblique views of the sacroiliac joints). MRI is not warranted and would result in lost points. Lab work should include HLA-B27 and ESR to exclude inflammatory sacroiliitis.
4. Therapy includes core strengthening, stretching (specifically of the hamstrings), strengthening of the legs and gluteus group, manual therapy, and modalities (ultrasound, iontophoresis, electrical stimulation). Aquatherapy can be considered. If conservative management is not helping or tolerated, an SI joint steroid injection may be helpful. If the relief is only temporary, prolotherapy or medial branch cauterization might also be considered. Fusion of the SI joint is a last-resort procedure.
5. Her future employer would be required to make reasonable accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. One accommodation she could ask for is a standing frame for her desktop computer, allowing her to alternate between sitting and standing while working.
6. You need to call her and explain the facts of the situation. Ask her if she has experienced any ill effects. Tell her of whatever guidelines have been issued regarding monitoring and treatment. If she asks about legal action, you should advise her that you are not an attorney, but she may want to ask for advice from one. You should neither encourage nor discourage legal action.

# CASE 4: GENERALIZED MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN

A 25-year-old woman presents with a 2-month history of pain in the neck, shoulders, back, and hips. She has no significant past medical history, and has had no trauma.

# Questions

1. What more do you want to know about her history?
2. She has generalized achy pain. There are no radicular symptoms and no joint swelling. Pain interrupts her sleep. She gets no exercise. What physical exam elements are important?
3. What is the differential diagnosis, and what diagnostic testing is appropriate?
4. She has no evidence of inflammatory arthritis on her labs. She has a normal MRI of the brain and cervical spine. What are key elements of the treatment plan?
5. She states that exercise just makes her worse. Explain to the patient the importance of exercise for this diagnosis.
6. She tells you she wants to apply for Social Security disability. How should you respond?
---
# 9: PAIN AND SPINAL IMPAIRMENTS

Answers
1. You should question pe patient about pe character of pe pain, exacerbating and relieving factors, radiation, arpralgias, numbness, weakness, and bowel and bladder symptoms. You should ask about sleep, exercise, and vocational and avocational interests. You should ask about past medical and family history.
2. Joints should be examined for synovitis and range of motion. A spine exam including Hoffman's and Spurling's tests should be performed. A porough neurologic exam should include a check of motor and sensory impairments, reflexes, and balance. A tender point exam should be performed (Figure 9.2).
3. The differential diagnosis for diffuse axial pain in a young person includes cervical spine disease, Arnold Chiari malformation, myositis, inflammatory arpritis, multiple sclerosis, and fibromyalgia (FM). FM is a diagnosis of exclusion. Testing should include an autoimmune profile, CK, and MRI of pe c-spine and brain.
4. She likely has FM. Treatment focuses on improving sleep and gradual increase in exercise. Medications effective for FM include pregabalin, gabapentin, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). The combination of pregabalin and duloxetine has been shown to be more effective pan eiper alone. Secondary medications include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and cyclobenzaprine. Sleep medication, particularly over-pe-counter agents such as melatonin or diphenhydramine, may be helpful. Opioids and NSAIDs are generally not effective for FM and should be avoided.
5. First explain pe scientific evidence for exercise in FM in lay terms. Behavioral interviewing would be helpful. Engage her in readiness for change, ask about barriers to exercise, and explain how she could overcome pese barriers.
6. Social Security Disability has a very high preshold for qualification. She would need to demonstrate pat she is unable to perform any work, irrespective of occupation. Most people wip FM are able to work at least sedentary jobs. She would likely get rejected.

# Case 5: Chronic Hand Pain

A 35-year-old man fractured his left distal radius and ulnar in a fall 6 weeks ago. Upon removing the cast, his hand is exquisitely swollen, painful, and tender. Figure 9.3 shows its appearance.

# Questions

1. What more do you want to know about his history and physical exam?
2. He has no relevant past medical history. He has diffuse allodynia and hyperalgesia in his hand. It is cool. There is hair loss and nail bed changes. What is the differential diagnosis? What diagnostic testing should be ordered?
3. Explain his diagnosis to him in lay terms.
4. Compartment pressures are normal. The patient could not tolerate EMG/NCS. X-ray shows a well-healed fracture but diffuse osteopenia of the hand. What is the treatment plan?
5. The fall occurred at work. He is a fast order chef. What obligations does his employer (or workers compensation insurer) have in terms of his rehabilitation and compensation?

# 9: PAIN AND SPINAL IMPAIRMENTS

# CASE 5: CHRONIC HAND PAIN

Answers
1. How did pe fracture occur? What is pe character of pe pain? Does he have involvement of any oper joints? Does he have any significant past history?
2. Differential diagnosis includes compartment syndrome, non-union, nerve injury, and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Compartment pressures should be checked urgently. Electrodiagnostic testing can be helpful if tolerated. X-rays should be obtained to look at fracture healing as well as osteopenia, which can be seen in severe CRPS.
3. Using eighp-grade level language, explain how CRPS is a misfiring of nerve impulses from pe limb to pe brain. Explain what is meant by vasomotor changes—swelling and temperature changes.
4. He likely has CRPS. A stellate ganglion block is pe best initial treatment in acute onset upper limb CRPS. Neuropapic pain medicines such as gabapentin or SNRIs may help. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may also be helpful. The role of corticosteroids is unclear, but a short course might be tried. Physical or occupational hand perapy can include contrast baps, fluidoperapy, compression wraps, desensitization techniques, range of motion, and strengpening as tolerated. Early return to activity is pought to be helpful.
5. The employer is responsible for providing not only medical treatments but comprehensive rehabilitation including vocational services not typically covered by medical insurance. In addition, pe employer must provide compensation until pe patient can return to his old job. If pe employee is unable to return to his previous job (permanent disability), pen pe employer must provide re-training for oper work, or pay a permanent disability reward based on his level of impairment and his previous income.

# CASE 6: NECK AND HAND PAIN

A 52-year-old, right-handed man was referred to your clinic by his primary care provider. He complains of neck and right hand pain, as well as numbness and tingling in the right forearm and hand. His primary care provider prescribed him tramadol 50 mg PO TID and gave him a referral to physical therapy. He went to one session of physical therapy, but it made his symptoms worse.

# Questions

1. What other information would you like to know about the history of his condition?
2. His symptoms have come and gone over the years, but became much worse when suddenly, at work as a mechanic, he felt a sharp, shooting pain down his arm. His pain is in the lateral half of his hand and fingers and up his lateral forearm. No recent injuries and no history of neck or carpal tunnel surgery are reported. He is having a hard time gripping and lifting with his right hand and arm and hasn’t been able to go to work. He hasn’t noticed any gait, bladder, or bowel changes. He has no fevers, recent weight loss, or history of cancer. His vital signs are within normal limits. What is important to do on physical exam?
3. He has decreased sensation in the C6 and C7 distribution, he has 4/5 strength of the finger abductors and wrist extensors, his brachioradialis deep tendon reflex is absent on the right, the Hoffman’s test is negative, a Babinski test causes downgoing of the toes, right-sided Spurling’s maneuver causes shooting pain from the neck into the arm, Phalen’s test is negative, Tinel’s test is negative at the wrist and elbow, his neck range of motion is normal, and there is no obvious neck deformity or tenderness to palpation of his neck. What is your differential diagnosis?
4. What tests would be appropriate to order to confirm your diagnosis?
5. Cervical x-rays show multilevel degenerative changes and narrowing of the disc space at C6-7, without any instability. Cervical MRI shows a C6-7 posterior lateral disc bulge with right-sided C6-7 neural foraminal narrowing (Figure 9.4). NCS/EMG, if ordered, reveals a C6-7 radiculopathy. You diagnose him with cervical radiculopathy. What are his options for treatment?
6. He asks for a physician work release. Would a work release be appropriate for his particular case?
7. He is resistant to returning to PT. Counsel him about the importance of this.

# CASE 6: NECK AND HAND PAIN

Answers

1. Additional information includes onset of symptoms (gradual vs. sudden), exact location of pain, aggravating/alleviating factors, history of trauma, any history of neck/arm surgery, any associated weakness, any associated bladder or bowel dysfunction, any fevers, and any history of cancer.
2. Test for sensation in the affected limb, manual muscle testing, deep tendon reflexes, Hoffman’s test, Babinski test, Spurling’s maneuver, Phalen’s maneuver, Tinel’s test at the wrist, cervical range of motion, and inspection and palpation of the cervical spine.
3. The differential diagnosis involves cervical radiculopathy, cervical stenosis, brachial plexopathy, peripheral neuropathy (including entrapment neuropathies), and forearm tendinopathy.
4. Cervical spine x-rays (including flexion and extension views to look for instability) would be appropriate immediately if there is any history of trauma. A cervical MRI without contrast (contrast if cancer or infection is likely) is appropriate because of his subjective and objective neurologic deficit (weakness). Electromyography and nerve conduction study (EMG/NCS) could be ordered if there is a need to discern between spinal causes versus a peripheral cause such as carpal tunnel.
5. Ice/heat and massage are used for symptom management. NSAIDs (if no medical contraindications) can be prescribed. An oral steroid taper (e.g., Medrol Dose Pak) can be helpful to minimize inflammation and reduce pain while the patient is undergoing workup or conservative treatment. Neuropathic medications (such as gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, duloxetine) can help to treat the neuropathic component of pain. Opioids can help reduce pain, aid in sleep, and increase function (short-term only for severe pain and loss of function). Physical therapy can often help resolve radicular pain and is typically considered first-line treatment (manual treatment, modalities, traction, range of motion exercises). Cervical epidural steroid injections can decrease pain and may be indicated in this case of an identifiable cause of cervical radicular pain. Surgical referral would be appropriate and indicated if the patient does not respond to conservative treatment and has ongoing or worsening weakness.
6. A work release may be appropriate. We know he works as a mechanic and has been unable to perform his duties due to pain and weakness. Although he may not be able to perform his mechanic duties, it is important for him to explore whether or not his employer has opportunities for restricted work duties before fully relieving him of work. Patients who continue to stay at work or only take a short time off are more likely to return to work.
7. Explain how physical therapy is often painful the first few sessions, but provides longer term relief. In most cases, surgery can be avoided. The modalities and traction may reduce muscle spasm and pain. The exercises can strengthen muscles and stabilize the spine.

# CASE 7: LOW BACK PAIN IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

A 49-year-old, left-handed female presents to your clinic with low back pain. She states that she has had the pain for years and it has gradually gotten much worse. In the past, it would come and go over the period of a few days. Now it is more persistent on a daily basis, especially in the morning and when she stays in any position for too long.

# Questions

1. What other information would you like to know about her condition?
2. Her pain is located over the low back (lumbar) area. She does not recall having any pain or numbness going down the thighs or legs, nor any weakness to report. Her pain can range from a 2/10 to 9/10. It tends to be worse after rest or when going from a bent over position to standing. She does not have any history of trauma, surgery, or cancer. She does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence, nor does she report any fevers. What physical exam tests would be important to aid in diagnosis?
3. Her strength, sensation, reflexes, and gait are all within normal limitations. A Babinski test reveals downgoing of the toes bilaterally. She has a mild degree of lumbar scoliosis, mild pain to palpation of the lumbar paravertebral muscles, and worsening pain with extension maneuvers of the lumbar spine. FABER test does not reveal worsening pain and there is no pain over the sacroiliac joints. What is your differential diagnosis?
4. If the patient has failed conservative treatment before seeing you, what radiographic studies could aid in confirming diagnosis? Assuming no contraindications to the study, if imaging was ordered, what study would be the most appropriate given her lack of neurologic signs and symptoms?
5. A lumbar PA and lateral x-ray reveals lumbosacral spondylosis with moderate to severe facet joint arthropathy. What options for treatment does she have? Apart from basic conservative measures and pharmacological treatment, what is the next best treatment option for this patient?
6. Explain RFA to the patient in lay terms.
7. She returns to clinic after attending only one physical therapy session. She states that she cannot afford the co-pay on her insurance. She is, however, highly motivated to exercise. What options might she have?

# CASE 7: LOW BACK PAIN IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

Answers

1. Other relevant information includes the exact location of pain (any radiating symptoms [i.e., into the thighs/legs]), intensity of pain, aggravating/alleviating factors, history of trauma or back surgery, any associated weakness, any associated bladder or bowel dysfunction, any fevers, and any history of cancer.
2. Exam should include sensation of lower limbs, manual muscle testing, deep tendon reflexes, Babinski test, inspection and palpation of the lumbar spine and sacrum, range of motion of the lumbar spine, straight leg raising, facet joint loading, and special sacroiliac joint tests.
3. Differential diagnosis includes lumbar facet arthropathy, degenerative intervertebral disc disease (annular tear), lumbar myofascial pain, vertebral compression fracture, lumbar spondylolisthesis/spondylolysis, and sacroiliac joint arthropathy.
4. Possible studies are a lumbar x-ray, lumbar CT (only if an MRI is contraindicated), or lumbar MRI. It would be appropriate to attempt a course of conservative measures prior to obtaining imaging. A lumbar x-ray would be the most appropriate radiographic study (at least PA and lateral views; oblique views would aid in diagnosis of listhesis). An MRI should be reserved for patients with neurologic deficits, or for those with a high certainty of fracture, infection, or cancer, or failure of conservative treatment.
5. Conservative measures such as ice, heat, massage, acupuncture, chiropractic/osteopathic manipulation, and cognitive behavioral therapy are the next best treatments; NSAIDs are an option (if medically appropriate). Opioids should be used in the short term only for severe pain and loss of function. Physical therapy (manual treatment, modalities, core strengthening, and range of motion exercises) can also be beneficial. Facet joint injections or medial branch blocks with resultant RFA can be used if conservative management fails.
6. RFA deadens the nerve to the involved joint, reducing pain, often for a year or more when successful.
7. Exercise routines such as yoga or Pilates can be performed at home with instructional videos readily available on the Internet. These routines often have similar core strengthening exercises that a physical therapist might prescribe. She should be counseled about safety in doing these routines.

# CASE 8: OLDER PATIENT WITH MID BACK PAIN

A 74-year-old female comes to your office with a chief complaint of back pain for 3 weeks that has progressively gotten worse since the onset.

# Questions

1. What other information would you like to know about her condition?
2. Her pain is located over the mid-to-lower back (thoracolumbar) area. She denies any weakness and pain or numbness going down the thighs or legs. Her pain ranges from a persistent 6-10/10. Lately it has been getting much worse. Her pain tends to get worse when bending forward. She does recall falling a few weeks back when rolling out of bed, but didn’t have any immediate pain at the time; the pain started 2 days later. She does not have any history of surgery or cancer. She does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence and does not report any fever. What physical exam tests would be important to aid in diagnosis?
3. Her strength, sensation, reflexes, and gait are all within normal limitations. A Babinski test reveals downgoing toes bilaterally. She has a mild degree of lumbar scoliosis, and severe pain to palpation of the midline thoracolumbar junction. There is worsening pain with flexion maneuvers of the spine. What is your differential diagnosis?
4. What would be your next best step in diagnosis?
5. An MRI confirms your suspicion of a superior endplate vertebral compression fracture at L1. There is no neurologic compromise and no retropulsive fragments of bone, but there is a vertebral height loss of 20%. There is bone marrow edema seen on T2 images, indicating an acute-subacute fracture. Explain this to the patient in lay terms.
6. What are the important components of treatment?
7. Her fracture was the result of a fall. It is important for physicians to intervene to help prevent future falls. What additional questions should be asked?

# CASE 8: OLDER PATIENT WITH MID BACK PAIN

Answers
1. Oper relevant information includes pe exact location of pain (any radiating symptoms; i.e., into pe pighs/legs), intensity of pain, aggravating/alleviating factors, history of trauma, any history of back surgery, any associated weakness, any associated bladder or bowel dysfunction, any fevers, or any history of cancer.
2. Test   pe sensation of lower limbs, manual muscle testing, deep tendon reflexes, Babinski test, inspection and palpation of pe entire spine, and range of motion of pe lumbar spine.
3. The   differential diagnosis includes vertebral compression fracture, discitis/ osteomyelitis, spinal tumor, poracolumbar spondylolysis/spondylolispesis, and facet syndrome.
4. The next best step would be to obtain an MRI of pe poracic and lumbar spine. Based on her history of a recent fall, her age, gender, and severe pain wip palpation of pe spine in pe midline, she most likely has a fracture. An MRI would be pe diagnostic modality of choice to not only evaluate a potential vertebral compression fracture, but would also help define pe age of pe fracture and give important details for interventional decision making. An MRI would also help to evaluate for potential tumors (spinal metastasis) or an infection.
5. She has a compression fracture (partially crushed bone in her back). It is not unstable, and will likely heal in a few weeks. Surgery is rarely required.
6. Important      components         of  treatment      are    pain   control,     maintenance      of weight-bearing activity (walking aids if indicated), and potential fracture stabilization (bracing, vertebral augmentation such as vertebroplasty/kyph- oplasty, or surgical treatment). Fracture stabilization is important to prevent worsening of pe fracture while it is healing. At                  minimum a lumbar brace (lumbosacral orposis [LSO]) should be ordered.                     A   cruciform-anterior-spi- nal-hyperextension orposis (CASH) brace helps place pe lumbar spine in extension and prevents pe potential damaging forces of flexion on a com- pression fracture and would be indicated (Figure 9.5). Indications for vertebral augmentation include: failure of pain control despite conservative treatment/ bracing, worsening of fracture despite conservative treatment, minimal to no retropulsion of fracture, and no neurologic deficit due to pe fracture. Surgery is indicated if pere is more pan a few                millimeters of retropulsion of pe fracture wip failure of conservative treatment, or if pere is any neurologic deficits from pe fracture, and/or if pe fracture has become vertebra plana (almost complete height loss of pe vertebral body) wip continued pain.
7. Prevention of future fractures is also important. Patients should have appropriate workup for potential causes of pe fracture such as osteoporosis or tumors if indicated, and pen receive appropriate treatment (such as bisphos- phonates, calcium, and vitamin D for osteoporotic patients). A weight-bearing exercise program should ensue once pe fracture is healed.

# CASE 9: ACUTE BACK PAIN

A 39-year-old male comes to your clinic because of 3 days of low back pain. He was referred to your clinic from the emergency department, where he went yesterday when his pain suddenly got much worse. They gave him some pain medicine and made him an appointment with you. He describes his pain as a deep ache in the low back and then it sometimes radiates up the low back on each side. It started when he was at work 3 days ago. He doesn’t remember any specific event causing it. It gradually started to hurt and then got worse. He has never had any pain like this before.

Questions

1. What “red flag symptoms/signs” would you want to ask about to rule out the need for more immediate treatment or testing?
2. He denies all “red flag symptoms/signs.” What would be the important components of the physical exam?
3. He has a normal exam except for some tenderness in the bilateral lumbar paraspinal muscles and decreased range of motion of the lumbar spine due to pain. What is the likely diagnosis?
4. What are the most important components of treatment for this condition?
5. The patient is relieved to hear that his pain is not likely a serious problem but wants to know what you are going to do to treat his symptoms. He has been using acetaminophen but it has not been helping much. What class of medication has shown good evidence for treatment of back pain? What risks come with using such a medication?
6. The patient wants something stronger than NSAIDs and acetaminophen for his pain. He is demanding “real” pain medicine. He says the other medication is not going to work and he cannot stand the pain anymore. How would you respond?
7. Describe how you might initiate a quality improvement project in your practice to reduce the amount of unnecessary radiographs ordered for acute back pain.

# CASE 9: ACUTE BACK PAIN

Answers
1. Symptoms to consider include weakness, saddle anespesia, bowel and/or bladder incontinence, fevers/chills, recent major unintentional weight loss/gain, history of cancer, major trauma, systemic prolonged steroid use, family history of inflammatory arpritis, or signs of more systemic disease (iritis, skin rashes, colitis, urepral discharge, etc.).
2. The physical exam should include a neurologic exam (strengp, sensation, reflexes, primitive reflexes) and musculoskeletal exam (inspection, palpation, range of motion of pe low back and sacroiliac joints, provocative tests, gait analysis).
3. The likely diagnosis is mechanical low back pain.
4. Treatment components include patient reassurance and education (pis is a great opportunity to assure pe patient his pain is likely to resolve and currently does not demonstrate any major serious concern), exercise/movement (pe patient needs to continue to move eiper prough a home program or wip skilled perapy), and symptom control.
5. NSAIDs have been effective. Risks of major concern when using NSAIDs include GI discomfort and bleeding, renal dysfunction leading to high blood pressure, and cardiovascular risks.
6. This is a great opportunity to educate pe patient about opioid pain medications and pe risks of starting/using such medication. He should understand pe risks of misuse, dependence, abuse, and pe reasons for attempting non-opioid alternatives first. Opioid prescribing guidelines have been issued for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. While pis patient currently has acute pain, pe guidelines are appropriate whenever opioids are being considered, which include: using pe lowest dose possible, only prescribing what is needed for pe situation, frequent re-evaluation, documentation of functional benefits pat validate pe use of opioids, and potential urine drug screening to rule out pe use of oper controlled or illicit drugs pat make prescribing opioids dangerous.
7. X-rays are indicated only for significant trauma or positive “red flags.” You could start wip a retrospective review of how often pese guidelines are violated. Educate your colleagues and pe patients on pe guidelines, and prospectively see pe impact. Continue wip a PDSA (plan, do, see, and act) cycle by adapting various educational techniques to see which is pe most effective.

# CASE 1: DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY

A mother brings her 15-month-old in for evaluation due to possible developmental delay. Records brought to the visit reveal the child was adopted from China at the age of 12 months. Prenatal and birth history is not available and medical/developmental information is limited. The mom does know the child was born full term. The child lived in an orphanage until adoption. Mom reports the child is not yet walking but is beginning to pull to stand. The child favors the right hand, which was noted at the orphanage.

# Questions

1. What further questions would you ask?
2. How would you examine the patient?
3. The child is demonstrating a left hemiplegia. MRI of the brain is recommended to evaluate further for possible ischemic stroke or cerebral dysgenesis. The MRI reveals a middle cerebral artery infarction that is likely intrauterine or perinatal. The mom asks about the child’s diagnosis. Based on the examination, what diagnosis are you considering and what testing do you recommend?
4. What therapies would you recommend for this child?
5. Mom asks, “Will my child walk and be normal like other kids?” What is your response?
6. As you are finishing the visit, the mother tells you she cannot afford the co-payments on the child’s rehabilitation therapies. What options does she have?

# CASE 1: DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY

Answers
1. Information regarding oper developmental skills should be obtained including sitting, standing, holding onto a table or wip assistance, cruising, grasp abilities of pe hands, and what activities can be done wip pe left hand/arm. Information should be obtained about speech, oral motor skills, and eating. Are pere vision or hearing issues? History of seizures? Any imaging or oper evaluations pat have been completed?
2. Physical exam findings include decreased active/functional use of pe left upper extremity. Active movement of pe wrist is noted for flexion and extension wip reaching. The left hand tends to remain closed alpough passively range is full. Left lower extremity wip decreased range at pe ankle and mild tightness of pe hamstring is noted, as well as two beats of clonus at pe ankle. The child is able to sit independently and can come to sit, typically using pe right extremity. When placed in supported standing pe right foot is flat and pe left is plantar flexed at initial foot contact but can relax to foot flat. The child speaks at least 5 to 10 words in Chinese and says 3 to 4 words in English.
3. Based on history, physical examination, and imaging, pis child can be diagnosed wip left hemiplegic cerebral palsy. The current definition of cerebral palsy is pat it defines a group of disorders of pe development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, pat are attributed to nonprogressive disturbances pat occurred in pe developing fetal or infant brain.
4. Constraint-induced movement perapy (CIMT) should be recommended in pis child to facilitate spontaneous use of pe left upper extremity, as well as functional finger movements. Physical perapy should be recommended to facilitate gross motor skills including standing and ambulation. As pe child starts to do more weight bearing and ambulation, foot and ankle position should be monitored to determine pe need for bracing to facilitate a normal gait pattern. Activities to encourage muscle strengpening and functional use are incorporated into play skills.
5. Children wip hemiplegia due to perinatal ischemic stroke typically are independent ambulators and walk by age 2 if not sooner. Most kids develop functional use of pe affected hand but for some fine motor skills may be impaired. Most have normal intelligence and participate in a regular school program and typical recreational activities. If upper extremity weakness causes functional impairments, accommodations can be made.
6. The child may be eligible for perapy in preschool.

# CASE 2: TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

A 6-year-old girl is admitted to a pediatric rehabilitation unit 3 months following a severe traumatic brain injury. The initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5 with prolonged loss of consciousness.

# Questions

1. What key elements do you want to know from the history and examination that will shape the rehabilitation plan?
2. The child was in a coma for 7 days. She reports no pain. She is verbal but oriented to person only. She has no hemiparesis. She has progressed to a Rancho 4/5 level and is becoming agitated on the unit. She has kicked and bitten staff members. What strategies can be used to help manage the agitation, both nonmedication and medication? What are the risks/side effects associated with medication use?
3. The patient is very inattentive and is difficult to keep on task in therapy sessions. What recommendations can you provide to the team?
4. What are the developmental concerns regarding a patient of this age?
5. The patient has been in inpatient rehabilitation for 3 weeks and is no longer agitated but safety concerns persist due to inattention and short-term memory problems. What considerations would you have in planning for her discharge?

# 10: PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION

# CASE 2: TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

# Answers

1. The following are important factors:

- a. Rancho level
- b. Duration of coma
- c. Ability to communicate
- d. Presence of pain
- e. Muscle strength
- f. Presence of contractures
- g. Cognitive exam
- h. Sensation
- i. Skin integrity
- j. Functional assessment
2. Strategies may include environmental changes as well as medications:

- Environmental strategies:

- Avoid overstimulation
- Maintain a quiet environment
- Have consistent staff treat the patient
- Provide frequent reassurance
- Evaluate the impact of visitors and therapy and limit if causing agitation
- Promote adequate sleep
- Avoid use of restraints
- Pharmacological strategies: Literature involving pediatric patients is limited.

- Benzodiazepines may be utilized but are not considered a good long-term solution. They may cause sedation and decreased concentration.
- Beta blockers may be used until the intensity of agitation decreases. Side effects include bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and fatigue.
- Anticonvulsants’ side effects may include negative effects on cognitive and motor function.
- Antipsychotics; adult studies have shown slow cognitive improvement or decreased cognitive return. The side effect list is long and can include weight gain, extrapyramidal symptoms, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
3. Strategies include:

- Pharmacological: There are limited studies; however, methylphenidate may be utilized and in several studies has shown improvement on test scores, as well as improved parent and teacher reports. Other stimulants have been clinically used as well.
- Minimize distraction by treating in a quiet room or area with less distractions.
- Give breaks as needed.
- Use preferred activities as a reward.
4. Family dysfunction and stress have been shown to increase following pediatric brain injury. In children the developmental stage may impact response to therapy and outcomes. Children with a brain injury are at increased risk for negative outcomes compared to adults. Injury during early childhood and elementary school may cause worse outcomes compared to children injured.

# 10: PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION

When children are injured at a younger age, it can impair their ability to gain the skills needed for later development. Milestones may not be reached, hindering the child's ability to acquire new skills. School reintegration is a crucial goal for school-age children. As schooling progresses, the complexity of demands increases. Children post brain injury, who struggle with memory and executive functioning, may find it challenging to manage the heightened complexity of demands and may fall behind their peers.

Discharge plans should include:

- Parental education
- Transition to a special education program in school with an individualized education plan
- Ongoing physical, occupational, and speech therapy in school

# CASE 3: BACK PAIN IN CHILDREN

An 11-year-old gymnast sees you for low back pain. She is very active in her sport and participates in local and regional competitions.

Questions

1. What information would you like to obtain on history and physical examination?
2. Pain is relatively sharp and worse with extension. On examination, she has tightness of her hamstrings and quads. There is localized tenderness in the left upper lumbar paraspinal musculature. Pain does not radiate into the lower limbs and strength is normal. What is your differential diagnosis? What diagnostic testing will you order? If an x-ray is ordered, what views would you order and why?
3. Lumbar x-ray (AP and lateral only) shows no abnormalities. MRI is normal. What is your next step? What instructions will you give to the patient?
4. Four weeks later the patient’s flexibility has improved greatly, but she continues to report pain. What further imaging would you order?
5. Based on the evaluation to this point what is your next step?
6. In lay terms, explain the diagnosis to the patient and parents.
7. Her parents want to know, “When can she return to gymnastics?” How would you respond?

# CASE 3: BACK PAIN IN CHILDREN

Answers

1. It is critical to assess the onset and duration of pain and if there were any acute trauma, as well as exacerbating or remitting factors. A lower limb neurologic examination should be completed.
2. Differential diagnosis includes spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, lumbar strain, tumor, or infection. Tests include x-ray lumbar spine or MRI lumbar spine.
3. The next step is physical therapy directed at lower limb flexibility, core strengthening, and modalities for pain. Instructions include temporary removal from extension-based activities (removal from sport).
4. Imaging: MRI if not already ordered (normal) and a SPECT scan. The SPECT scan shows uptake at the bilateral L5 pars interarticularis. (This can be missed on MRI.) You may then order a thin cut CT through the area of uptake. CT shows bilateral L5 pars low-grade stress fracture (Figure 10.1).
5. Next step is Boston bracing for 3 months with continued follow-up; spine surgery if the fracture progresses.
6. This should be done in eighth-grade language. Her backbone is cracked, and may slip out of place.
7. This is a very serious injury that often results in major surgery should it progress. It would probably be better if she pursued a noncontact sport. She certainly should not return to gymnastics until the pars fracture is healed.

# CASE 4: SCOLIOSIS

An 11-year-old female presents to your office with her mother. The mother states that the patient was undergoing a routine physical examination by her family doctor for sports participation when she was found to have scoliosis. She was then referred to you for management.

# Questions

1. What are some important factors to consider when collecting the patient history to help determine if the scoliosis is congenital, neuromuscular, or idiopathic?
2. She does not complain of any neurologic symptoms, has a normal birth history and childhood, and there is no relevant family history. Taking into consideration the referring diagnosis, what are the key components of her physical examination?
3. On exam you find no dysmorphic anatomy or any signs of congenital disease. She is neurologically intact with normal strength, sensation, and reflexes. Her spine has a rightward thoracolumbar curve and there is protrusion of the right rib cage and scapula. What diagnostic test(s) would you order? What would be the next step in management?
4. The radiographs show a 20 degree curvature. The mother asks why her daughter has a curved spine and if her daughter is going to need surgery. How would you respond? She then asks if her daughter will need a back brace or any additional treatments. How would you respond?
5. The patient expresses concern about her appearance. How can this be addressed?

# CASE 4: SCOLIOSIS

# Answers

1. Are there any pain or neurologic symptoms present (i.e., numbness, tingling, or weakness)? What is the patient’s birth and pediatric milestone history (including growth)? Is there a family history of scoliosis or neuromuscular disease?
2. Key components include inspection/observation (any dysmorphic features or other signs of neuromuscular disorders; i.e., café-au-lait spots, dimpling of skin or tuft of hair over low back, long fingers or chest deformities); neuro-logic exam of cranial nerves and limbs (sensation, reflexes, and strength); musculoskeletal exam (inspection/palpation of spine and limbs, range of motion of spine, chest expansion, gait analysis).
3. Diagnostic tests include standing upright, plain radiographs of the spine (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar to measure degree of scoliosis), as well as pelvic radiograph (to measure Risser grade and better predict bone growth potential). If the curvature is <30 degrees, management is conservative with repeat x-rays in 1 year.
4. This is a great opportunity for patient and parent education regarding the patient’s condition. There should be a discussion about the types of scoliosis (congenital, neuromuscular, and idiopathic), about how the most common cause is idiopathic, and how most cases do not require surgery. Also assure the parent that you will refer the patient to the appropriate surgical specialist if needed. Clarity of explanation and ability to give information in a compassionate, thoughtful, and caring manner are necessary. It is okay to tell the patient and the parent/caregiver that you do not know. Whether or not the patient will require bracing or any further treatment will be based on the degree of curvature, the potential for future growth, and the progression of the scoliotic curve over time. This is an opportunity to again educate the patient and parent in a clear, compassionate, and thoughtful manner.
5. Peer counseling can be beneficial if you have a support group in your area. Alternatively, psychological counseling may be needed, particularly if depressive symptoms develop.

# CASE 5: SPINA BIFIDA

A 14-year-old female with a S2 sacral level myelomeningocele comes into the examination room using Lofstrand crutches. She appears uncomfortable and complains of “tingly” feelings in her feet and increased fatigue. At her last visit 3 years ago, she did not require forearm crutches for short distance ambulation.

# Questions

1. What questions would you ask her to further delineate the cause of her weakness? What are key elements of your physical exam?
2. You learn her weakness is localized to the lower extremities. This began about 10 months ago following her last visit to Multidisciplinary Spina Bifida Clinic. She was scheduled to return in 6 months but missed that appointment. She reports that her back aches especially after a busy day at school. She also states that her feet “look different.” No fevers, headaches, diplopia, emesis, or lethargy is reported. She does have shunted hydrocephalus that has never required a revision. Vital signs are normal. She has no cranial nerve deficits. Vocal quality and volume is unchanged. Examination of the lower extremities shows left knee flexion is weaker than right. Foot inversion is weak on both sides. There is a calcaneo-valgus appearance of the foot. What is your differential diagnosis for her weakness?
3. What diagnostic tests are indicated?
4. Her MRI of the spine shows tethering of the cord at T11 to L1. What treatment would you recommend and what would you tell the patient and family?
5. Explain tethering of the cord in lay terms to the patient and family.
6. The reason she has not seen you in 3 years is that she missed her annual appointments in the spina bifida clinic. How would you address this with the patient and family?

# CASE 5: SPINA BIFIDA

|Answers|
|---|
|1. Does she have a ventricular shunt?|Does she have headaches, lethargy, diplopia, or unusual emesis?|
| |Is there a change in her bladder and/or bowel routine?|
| |Has she gained weight?|
| |A thorough neuromusculoskeletal exam would include cranial nerve exam, sensation, strength, and any deformities in her lower limbs.|
|2. Differential diagnosis includes shunt malfunction, tethered cord, syringomyelia, compressive bone abnormalities, weakness secondary to weight gain, and deconditioning.|
|3. Testing includes brain imaging CT or MRI, full spine MRI, spine x-rays or CT, and urodynamic testing. CT or MRI of the head is required to rule out obstructive hydrocephalus. In the absence of a shunt or evidence of a working shunt, an MRI of the entire spine should be performed. Other studies could include spine x-rays or spine CT to look for bony abnormalities and to assess for scoliosis. Manual muscle testing and urodynamic testing should also be performed to document any changes and to provide a presurgical baseline.|
|4. Referral should be made to a neurosurgeon. Since almost all patients with spina bifida have some evidence of tethering on MRI, clinical judgment that includes clear evidence of deterioration in function is required before surgical untethering. All previous neuroimaging studies should be brought to the appointment. Symptomatic tethering can occur at any time throughout life.|
|5. In eighth-grade language, explain that the cord has become tangled. Treatment is usually surgical. Be careful not to be too scary in your language, and emphasize that this is treatable when caught early.|
|6. Deterioration of function is more difficult to reverse the longer the tethering is untreated. It is important not to miss scheduled appointments to the Spina Bifida Program. One should not be judgmental and should ask why the patient missed the appointments. Did the patient refuse? Did the family lose medical insurance? Was transportation a problem?|

# CASE 6: PROGRESSIVE WEAKNESS IN A CHILD

A 5-year-old boy is brought to a pediatric PM&R clinic. His mother says he developed difficulty walking about 1 year ago. Otherwise, she had a normal pregnancy, and the patient walked normally until about 1 year ago. All vaccinations are up to date.

# Questions

1. What questions would you ask before planning for further diagnostic workup?
2. The mother says the patient uses his hands to stand up from the ground. The decline in strength started about 1 year ago. His sister is 2 years older and healthy. The mother states she was adopted, and does not know if anyone in her family had neurologic disorders. What are the important physical findings and diagnostic workup? List the differentials as well.
3. An electrodiagnostic study showed normal sensory conduction results, but EMG shows small units with early recruitment patterns in proximal muscles. A muscle biopsy showed many atrophic myofibers with extensive necrosis and intermysial fibrosis. A further genetic workup reveals a mutation in the dystrophin gene. What is the prognosis? What is the plan for medical and rehabilitative management?
4. Five years later, the patient comes back to your clinic, and his mother is concerned about his poor academic performance. Per his mother, he was an A student, but since the new semester, he appears tired all the time and is seen sleeping during the class. What is your approach to this problem?
5. Fifteen years later, the patient comes back to your clinic after having fallen off from a bed during transfer. He is complaining of chest pain. He is currently living in a group home, and is dependent with all aspects of activities of daily living. On inspection, there are multiple bruises in the chest and trunk, and some of them appear to be old. What would you do?

# CASE 6: PROGRESSIVE WEAKNESS IN A CHILD

Answers
1. Questions include time course/progression of symptoms; distribution of sensory symptoms, if any; pattern of muscle weakness; developmental delay; family history; and any musculoskeletal pain.
2. Items to evaluate are deep tendon reflexes; manual muscle testing; sensory exam; gait analysis; heart auscultation (to rule out murmur); general morphological inspection. Differentials include muscular dystrophy; spinal muscular atrophy; congenital myopapy; juvenile dermatomyositis; and mitochondrial myopapy.
3. This is a Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is a progressive, fatal disease. He will likely be wheelchair-dependent during his teenage years, and his expected life span is 20 to 30 years. Given pe progressive nature of pe disease, early rehabilitative intervention is important. For example, a rollator can be considered for ambulation at pis stage, but as he loses his ability to walk, a motorized wheelchair should be considered. Bracing is also needed to prevent scoliosis. In addition, he can be started on prednisone to delay pe progression of motor weakness, after discussion wip his family regarding potential benefits and risks.
4. Careful physical examination and medication history is important. Day-time narcolepsy is an early sign of respiratory distress due to reduced vital capacity, and history of sleep apnea should be obtained. If needed, pulmonary function tests should be considered. Psychosocial aspects of his school life should be examined as he is undergoing adolescence wip severe disability; symptoms of depression, his social life wip peers, and a possibility of bullying should be addressed

Physical exam of the chest, including inspection, palpation, and auscultation, is the first step to rule out any life-threatening conditions. If it appears that he has been neglected or abused at the group home, contacting Adult Protective Services should be considered. Communication with caretakers and family members should also be mentioned.

# CASE 1: CONTRACTURE

You are consulted on a 45-year-old woman with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy who was recently admitted to a nursing facility after her elderly parents were no longer able to care for her. She was ambulatory with forearm crutches until 3 years ago. She says her legs have become so bent up she can no longer stand on her own.

# Questions

1. What further information do you want to know?
2. You learn that they now use a Hoyer lift at the nursing facility to get her out of bed. She does not get physical therapy there, as she is in custodial care. The nursing staff does not perform range of motion or stretching with her. She is currently on baclofen 10 mg three times daily, but cannot tolerate higher doses as it makes her confused. She has no splints. As a child she remembers having serial casting, and that it helped. She had no surgeries. She had botulinum toxin injections in the past but they did not help, and were discontinued. What are key elements in the physical exam?
3. Her upper limbs are normal. She has fixed contractures of her hips, knees, and ankles. Her hips have 10-degree flexion contractures, her knees have 45-degree flexion contractures, and her ankles have 5-degree flexion contractures. Deep tendon reflexes are absent at knees and ankles; Babinski is up bilaterally. Due to the severity of her contractures, you cannot assess her tone. She has no skin breakdown. What diagnostic testing is indicated?
4. X-rays of her hips show shallow acetabulum bilaterally, but no other abnormality; x-rays of knees and ankles are normal. What is your treatment plan?
5. Explain to the patient in lay terms her diagnosis and treatment.
6. She has no remaining benefits for physical therapy, and the nursing home administration refuses to pay for dynamic splints, which would cost approximately $1,000. How would you approach this?

# CASE 1: CONTRACTURE

Answers
1. Questions include: How does pis affect her function? What is her mobility like? What treatment has she received in pe past or is currently receiving?
2. You would need to measure range of motion in pe limbs. You would also assess tone, reflexes, and upper tract signs. You would look for pressure sores.
3. X-rays of her joints are needed to look for heterotopic ossification or oper orpopedic abnormalities.
4. Treatment of her spasticity might include phenol injections or additional oral medications (dantrolene or tizanidine). She might be a candidate for an intra-pecal pump. However, treatment of her spasticity wipout treatment of pe mechanical contracture will be futile. She will need some form of prolonged stretching, eiper wip dynamic splints or serial casting.
5. Explain in eighp-grade language pat her tendons have shortened due to chronic muscle spasms. You will try to relieve pe spasms wip pe medications or injections, and will need to do a prolonged stretch of pe muscles wip splints or casts.
6. If you have pe skills, serial casting could be an option, but you would also need to make sure pe facility’s nursing staff is able to monitor pis. Unfortunately, when a patient is in a custodial level of care, physical perapy is not a covered benefit by insurance. Durable medical equipment must be provided by pe facility at peir cost. You can try to advocate wip pe administrator for pe dynamic splints, emphasizing risk of pressure sores if untreated. This would be a quality issue for pe nursing home, and pey could get cited.

CASE 2: PRESSURE SORE

A 28-year-old man with tetraplegia returns to the clinic for the first time in 5 years. He tells you he has not had medical problems and has come back to have the proper documentation for a manual wheelchair. Your physical exam is significant for C7 AIS A with a Zone of Partial Preservation to T1 for motor and sensory bilaterally.

# Questions

1. He has pressure sores on his buttocks (Figure 11.1). What key elements do you want to know about the pressure sores?
2. He has two clean pressure injuries that do not have signs of infection located at his bilateral ischial tuberosities that are Stage III and about 7 cm in the largest diameter. He has had them for about 3 months and is treating them himself with wet to dry dressing changes. What do you need to know from his ROS, functional, and social history?
3. He is in the wheelchair all day and performs weight shift whenever he remembers. He uses a sliding board to transfer independently. He often voids in a diaper for bowel and bladder because transfers are difficult. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day. What is the treatment plan for healing the pressure ulcers?
4. He returns in 6 months with the ischial wounds healed, but has now developed sacral and right greater trochanter wounds that are being managed by the wound care team. What durable medical equipment should be prescribed?
5. In lay terms, explain to him the importance of pressure relief.
6. An insurance reviewer requests a peer-to-peer conversation regarding the durable medical equipment you recently prescribed, specifically the power wheelchair with tilt-in-space feature and cushion with pressure mapping. How do you justify the wheelchair?

# 11: SOFT TISSUE IMPAIRMENTS

CASE 2: PRESSURE SORE

Answers

1. You would want to know the location, stage, tunneling, signs of infection, duration, and treatment.
2. You would need to know the constitutional information (weight gain, nutritional status), method of transfers, sitting time, weight shifts, bowel program, bladder program, and smoking history. Smoking increases risk of pressure sores.
3. Treatment involves referral to the wound care team, home health care referral for the wound care, no more sitting upright until pressure ulcers heal, smoking cessation, and a bowel and bladder program in bed.
4. Durable medical equipment prescribed should include a power wheelchair with tilt-in-space feature, cushion with pressure mapping, and air mattress.
5. Using eighth-grade language, explain that moving pressure off the buttocks every 2 hours is essential. Explain how his limited sensation impacts this.
6. Mobility in tetraplegia is challenging. Transfers are impossible to different elevations. The patient requires a power wheelchair with adjustable heights to help with his transfers. Likewise, weight shift is not possible with the weight gain and given the history of pressure injury; he requires a tilt-in-space feature.

# CASE 1: TRAUMATIC QUADRIPLEGIA WITH DECREASED HAND FUNCTION

A 35-year-old man with traumatic cervical spinal cord injury sustained 5 years ago in a motor vehicle accident status postcervical decompression and fusion presents to your clinic with complaints of loss of hand function. His physical exam from last year was significant for C7 AIS C.

# Questions

1. What key elements do you want to know from his history? What do you need to ask about in your review of systems?
2. The patient tells you that he has been having progressive loss of strength over 2 to 3 months in his bilateral hands, affecting his manual wheelchair propulsion over the past few months as well as his grip. He is also having hand and finger dysesthesias, and neck pain that feels like soreness. He denies changes in bowel and bladder function, and reports no falls or trauma. What is critical to do on physical exam?
3. Physical exam is significant for C5 sensory level with C7 motor level. The motor exam has not changed significantly from prior exams. Tinel’s and Phalen’s tests are equivocal bilaterally. What is the differential diagnosis of his progressive weakness? What diagnostic testing, if any, is indicated?
4. Cervical x-ray is negative for hardware failure and acute fracture, and MRI reveals no syrinx. EMG is significant for median neuropathy at the wrist. What intervention would help him?
5. Explain his diagnosis and treatment in lay terms.
6. He returns to clinic 1 month later and states that many of his symptoms have improved, but he continues to have difficulty propelling his manual wheelchair. How would you advise the patient?

# 12: SPINAL CORD INJURY

# CASE 1: TRAUMATIC QUADRIPLEGIA WITH DECREASED HAND FUNCTION

Answers

1. Over what time frame did the change occur? We need to know about sensory changes in the upper extremities, changes with his bowel program (constipation, accidents, etc.), changes with his bladder program (frequency, urgency, urinary tract infections, etc.), history of recent fall or trauma, and changes with neuropathic pain and/or paresthesia. Specific information is needed regarding the hand function loss. Review of systems should include constitutional issues (fevers, chills, and weight loss/gain), polydipsia, hunger, fatigue, and blurred vision (DMII symptoms).
2. Physical examination includes an American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale exam to determine change in neurologic level, rectal exam, shoulder exam, and Phalen’s and/or Tinel’s test.
3. Differential diagnosis includes carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy, radiculopathy, hardware failure and cord/root impingement, syringomyelia, and peripheral neuropathy. A cervical x-ray is indicated to rule out hardware failure, MRI of the cervical spine to rule out syringomyelia, and a bilateral NCS/EMG to rule out radiculopathy. A peripheral neuropathy test should be performed.
4. Treatment includes occupational therapy consultation for learning to improve wrist positioning during activities of daily living and ergonomic wheelchair adjustments, education on ergonomic workspace, wrist/hand orthosis to be worn while sleeping, and gabapentin/pregabalin/amitriptyline/nortriptyline for neuropathic pain management. If he fails to improve with this, corticosteroid injection can be considered. Surgery would be a last resort, especially since it might limit his ability to transfer independently during postoperative recovery.
5. With eighth-grade language, explain that carpal tunnel syndrome is a pinching of the nerve in the wrist that can weaken the hand muscles and cause pain. It comes from excessive pressure, such as propelling the wheelchair or transferring.
6. He should be seen by a therapist and evaluated for smart-assist wheels. He would also benefit from outpatient therapy for strengthening. Weight loss would also make wheelchair propulsion easier.

# CASE 2: POSTOPERATIVE PARESIS

A 56-year-old male presents to your clinic complaining of worsened weakness since his back surgery 3 weeks ago. He tells you that it was the third surgery on his lower back and he needed it because he was getting weak in his legs.

# Questions

1. What key elements do you want to know about his preoperative symptoms and workup?
2. He tells you that his operation was on L2 and L3 because of weakness in his legs and back pain. An MRI showed disc disease and herniation at the L2-3 level. EMG was significant for bilateral L3 radiculopathy. What do you want to know about his postoperative course?
3. He had an uncomplicated surgery. Postoperatively he had profound weakness in his feet that improved somewhat. He had an indwelling catheter that was removed on day of discharge and, after a long time, he voided about 1 liter of urine. He is now often incontinent of bowel and bladder. What are the critical components of the physical exam?
4. Why is incontinence such an important issue?
5. Physical exam is significant for 4/5 strength in L2 and L3, and 1/5 strength in L4-S1 myotomes, reduced sensation in L2-S5 dermatomes, 1+ patellar reflexes and areflexic in Achilles reflex, positive deep anal pressure, no voluntary anal contraction, and no anal wink with pin prick. What is your assessment? What is the plan for bowel and bladder management?
6. He has followed your program and has not had bowel or bladder accidents. However, he is concerned about his sexual function and wants to know what can be expected with treatment, if possible. What do you advise him about this?
---
# 12: SPINAL CORD INJURY

# CASE 2: POSTOPERATIVE PARESIS

Answers

1. Questions include: What were the indications for surgery (symptoms were pain, weakness, sensory loss, bowel or bladder incontinence, instability)? What vertebral levels were involved in the surgery? What previous workup has he had including imaging and electrodiagnostics? What is his current bowel and bladder function?
2. Did he have complications (infections, deep vein thrombosis, hemorrhage)? What symptoms did he have postoperatively (weakness, sensation, bowel/bladder)? What was his discharge location (home, acute, or subacute rehabilitation)?
3. Critical components are manual motor testing in the bilateral lower extremities (BLE), sensory testing in the BLE, deep tendon reflexes in the BLE, rectal exam with pin and light touch, and observation of anal wink reflex.
4. Incontinence is socially very disconcerting to patients. It can lead to skin breakdown. It is one of the most common reasons patients wind up in long-term facilities. The social and economic costs are enormous.
5. The assessment is L1 AIS C (conus medullaris syndrome) with lower motor neuron bowel and bladder. He should have a bowel program with promotility (senna, bisacodyl) and bulking (fiber) with an enema or manual disimpaction for daily bowel movement. Bladder will need urology follow up for urodynamics.
6. When discussing sexuality, it is useful to ask the patient about his or her perceptions, and to probe culturally what kind of detail the patient is comfortable discussing. Sildenafil (Viagra) is very efficacious for erectile dysfunction but not for ejaculation. He may have infertility because of this. Sperm donation with electro-ejaculation is possible.

CASE 3: SPASTICITY

A 35-year-old male presents to your clinic with C5 AIS C spinal cord injury complaining of worsening spasticity over the past year. The spasms interfere with his transfers and have caused him to fall several times. He is taking baclofen 20 mg four times daily, and complains of fatigue from it.

# Questions

1. What key questions do you have related to worsening spasticity?
2. The patient has not had noticeable differences with his sensation or strength. He has had more bladder accidents in between catheterizations and has had less production with his bowel program. What are the critical components of the physical exam?
3. His exam is stable with C5 AIS C. He has stool in his rectum and has decreased bowel sounds with a distended abdomen. Spasticity is 3/4 on the Modified Ashworth Scale for shoulder, elbow flexors and finger flexors, hip adductors, knee extensors and flexors, and ankle plantar- and dorsi-flexors. He has sustained clonus in upper and lower limbs. What imaging and/or laboratory analysis should be ordered and why?
4. After a few minutes, he returns having completed an abdominal x-ray that is significant for a large volume of stool and nephrolithiasis. What is the next course of management?
5. He returns to the clinic after successful lithotripsy and bowel cleanout. He continues to have spasticity for which he takes baclofen and he is concerned about the side effects of constipation and sedation. You added tizanidine, which made him orthostatic, and tried dantrolene but this made him feel weak all over. What other spasticity management would you recommend?
6. He does well with the baclofen pump trial. What psychosocial considerations are important to consider before placing the pump?
7. In lay terms, explain the risks and benefits of the baclofen pump to the patient.
---
# 12: SPINAL CORD INJURY

# CASE 3: SPASTICITY

# Answers

1. Questions include: Are there changes in the strength, sensation, bowel, and/or bladder program? Does he have any inciting irritation, for example, urinary tract infections, pressure sore, fecal impaction, or infection?
2. Critical components include the ISNCSCI exam (sensory, motor, rectal), spasticity test (Modified Ashworth or Tardieu Scale), presence of clonus, abdominal exam, and skin exam for pressure sores.
3. Urinalysis with culture is ordered to rule out urinary tract infection. Abdominal x-ray is ordered to evaluate stool burden.
4. Aggressive bowel cleanout (magnesium citrate or lactulose) and Fleet enema to reduce stool burden are the next steps. Improve the daily bowel program. A urologist follow-up for nephrolithiasis is recommended. Add tizanidine and/or dantrolene for his spasticity.
5. He is likely a candidate for an intrathecal baclofen pump, as he has generalized spasticity uncontrolled by oral medications. He should have a trial dose of intrathecal baclofen and, if successful, a pump installed.
6. Follow-up with a baclofen pump is critical, as an empty pump can be a fatal occurrence from baclofen withdrawal. He must have transportation available to get to appointments, or a home care agency in his area that can do refills. He has to be able to understand the signs and symptoms of withdrawal and overdose. And he will need insurance coverage for not only the procedure but the continued refills as well.
7. In eighth-grade language, explain how the pump delivers the medicine directly to the fluid around the spinal cord and brain, requiring a much smaller dose and with fewer side effects. However, explain the risk of sudden withdrawal if the pump is not refilled or the system fails. Also explain the risk of infection and meningitis. Explain catheter problems, and possible pump failure. Stress the importance of follow-up.

# CASE 4: AUTONOMIC DYSREFLEXIA

A 35-year-old male with C5 AIS A tetraplegia sustained in a motor vehicle collision 2 weeks ago is admitted to your inpatient rehabilitation unit. He has a tracheostomy and is on a ventilator at night, IV access in his right arm, and an indwelling Foley catheter. Nursing calls you immediately because of complaints of headache, flushing, and chills.

# Questions

1. What key elements do you want to know about his physical exam?
2. His systolic blood pressure is 150/95 mmHg, pulse is 55. Otherwise, vitals are within normal limits. His Foley is not draining. What are the next steps in the management of this patient?
3. The Foley flushes and his systolic blood pressure drops to 120 mmHg. The patient and family are concerned and want to know what happened and, if untreated, what could be the consequences. What do you tell him?
4. He has another episode of autonomic dysreflexia a week later. His systolic blood pressure is now 180 mmHg. You discover an edematous, erythematous, ingrown toenail. The podiatrist can come this evening to treat the patient. What is the management in the interim?
5. He returns to your outpatient clinic 1 month after discharge. He tells you that he does not consistently get his bowel program because his wife works during the day and his teenage daughter is not comfortable doing it. He gets autonomic dysreflexia once or twice a week due to constipation. What are alternatives for him?

# 12: SPINAL CORD INJURY

# CASE 4: AUTONOMIC DYSREFLEXIA

Answers
1. Check vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, pulse oximetry), penis, and drainage of Foley. One should do a rectal exam to exclude fecal impaction (done wip lidocaine gel). Check for pressure sores and ingrown nails.
2. Apply a blood pressure cuff for monitoring, loosen cloping, sit pe patient up, and flush pe Foley.
3. You need to educate pe family using lay terms. You need to explain how pe spinal cord injury affects internal organs in addition to pe arms and legs. Autonomic dysreflexia can lead to seizures, retinal hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, renal insufficiency, myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, and deap. You need to explain pe early warning signs such as flushing, sweating, and headache. You need to discuss how bowel, bladder, and skin care are important in preventing pis.
4. Hold from perapy until blood pressure is controlled; monitor vitals q 2 hours, and administer analgesics if needed using fast-acting antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure (nitro paste, nitroglycerine sublingual, hydralazine, nifedipine, or captopril).
5. In some states, Medicaid will provide home healp aides for several hours per day. Sometimes private insurance will provide pis as well. Usually pis is quite limited under Medicare. He may have to hire help, or alternatively, have his wife do pe bowel program in pe evenings when she is home.

# 12: SPINAL CORD INJURY

# CASE 5: CENTRAL CORD SYNDROME

An 85-year-old woman with central cord syndrome is on your inpatient rehabilitation service. She sustained a nonoperative spinal injury without fracture. She is wearing a Halo vest.

# Questions

1. What are the focused exam findings pertinent to the care of those wearing a Halo vest?
2. Her rehabilitation course was uneventful and she was discharged to a skilled nursing facility. She returns to your clinic 12 weeks later. The Halo vest was removed by the spine surgeon, and she is now wearing a hard cervical thoracic orthotic (SOMI) brace. She tells you she has had a red area on her jaw that is worsening despite ointments. What are the pertinent exam findings related to her skin?
3. You tell her she has developed a pressure ulcer, make the proper adjustments on the collar, and educate her about pressure relief. She tells you she has had her neck in a Halo and in this brace for over 3 months and would like to remove it entirely. She is sick and tired of wearing this. How should you respond?
4. One month later, she was discharged home requiring minimum assistance for ambulation and maximum assistance for activities of daily living. Her jaw pressure ulcer has healed and the brace has been discontinued by her surgeon. She returns to the clinic to discuss options for regaining upper extremity function. What do you prescribe?
5. She is interested in a stem cell treatment she found on the Internet that is only available in Asia. She tells you that after stem cell infusion IV and 3 months of therapy costing $12,000, testimonials report excellent neurologic recovery. She wants your opinion. How should you advise her?

# CASE 5: CENTRAL CORD SYNDROME

|Answers|Pertinent exam findings include pin site inspection, loosening of pins, and skin exam beneath the vest.|
|---|---|
| |Questions to ask include: Is it blanchable? Is the pressure from the hard collar at the site of erythema? Is the collar an appropriate size?|
| |Express understanding about her frustration. Unfortunately, she should not remove the collar until cleared by the surgeon after imaging reveals satisfactory healing. She should get flexion/extension films of the cervical spine prior to her next visit with the spine surgeon. Premature removal of bracing can lead to further spinal cord compression from spinal instability.|
| |Prescribe occupational therapy evaluations and therapy two or three times weekly, with upper limb functional electrical stimulation, robotics, wrist-hand orthotics, and assistive devices.|
| |You should highly discourage this: There is no biological mechanism and no evidence for efficacy. Money can be spent on home exercise equipment and therapy.|

# CASE 1: POST-STROKE DEPRESSION

A 59-year-old female has been in the inpatient rehabilitation unit for 2 weeks after a left frontal ischemic stroke. Her nurse indicates that the patient has been showing a rather flat affect and her daily food intake has been poor for the past 2 days.

# Questions

1. What would you like to know from your history and physical of the patient to assess these complaints?
2. The patient reports she feels like she’ll never get better: “What’s the point in going on like this?” She has poor sleep and appetite. She denies nausea, constipation, or diarrhea. Her physical exam is unchanged from admission. What are some screening tools that will help establish a diagnosis of poststroke depression?
3. Your evaluation of the stroke patient indicates that the patient had prestroke depression and is currently intermittently tearful during therapies along with significantly decreased appetite and some fatigue. What are the considerations for treatment of her poststroke depression?
4. The patient’s family asks whether there are any risk factors for poststroke depression and its prognosis. What will you discuss regarding this with the family?
5. The patient and her family are devout Wahhabi Muslims, and are adamantly opposed to the use of antidepressants on religious grounds. How would you approach this?

# STROKE REHABILITATION

# CASE 1: POST-STROKE DEPRESSION

Answers
1. The physician should get a good review of systems to ensure pat pe patient has no physiologic problems (e.g., nausea, constipation) causing pe loss of appetite. One should ask about vegetative signs of depression including mood, anhedonia (loss of interest in usual activities), change in sleep (insomnia or hypersomnia), and changes of appetite (anorexia or overeating). A depressed patient should always be questioned about suicidal ideation. The exam should include bop a neurologic and abdominal exam.
2. There are self-report screening tools pat help diagnose depression such as pe Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS). Observational scales include pe Post-stroke Depression Rating Scale (PDQRS) and Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire (SADQ-H 10 or 21). Poststroke depression is underdiagnosed in 50% to 80% of cases, and pe physiatrist should have a protocol to assess every stroke patient for depression. As part of history taking and interview, one has to ask questions about difficulty wip appetite, sleep, energy levels, or ability to concentrate. Poststroke depression can present as apapy (seen in 23% to 57% of stroke patients), in addition to expressed feelings of worplessness or poughts of deap or suicide.
3. While counseling and psychoperapy have shown little efficacy early in post-stroke depression, psychoperapy can be helpful wip minor depression and wip milder cognitive impairments. Wip apapy and lepargy in pis patient, psychostimulants such as mepylphenidate can be used first, followed by SSRIs. The most studied in poststroke depression treatment are citalopram, mirtazapine, and sertraline. Increasingly SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are also being used. There is no evidence pat one SSRI is better pan anoper. The physiatrist has to balance out pe benefits of using antidepressants versus pe risk of seizures, cognitive effects, and falls.
4. The physiatrist should tell pe patient’s family pat approximately one pird of stroke patients do develop clinically significant depression at some point after pe stroke. It is important to note pat poststroke depression is not related to any character weakness on pe patient’s part, and may result from physiologic changes in pe brain after stroke. Approximately 40% of pe patients develop symptoms wipin 3 monps of stroke. Many stroke patients can develop depression after discharge from pe inpatient rehabilitation unit. Interestingly, most patients wip major poststroke depression appear to recover significantly better pan minor post-stroke depression (PSD) by 2 years after pe stroke. There is controversy regarding pe location of pe left cortical and subcortical lesions as higher risk for depression. The level of disability (low Barpel index score), inadequate social support, coping style (especially catastrophic reaction and emotionalism), and prestroke history of depression are early predictors of poststroke depression.

5. Any competent adult has the right to refuse treatment, and if the patient lacks capacity, you need to defer to the closest family members. Explore alternatives, including clerical visits and family involvement, to improve her mood.

# CASE 2: UPPER LIMB PAIN IN STROKE

A 72-year-old male is admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit for comprehensive stroke rehabilitation. He has dense right hemiparesis 10 days following the stroke. For the past 2 days he has had right shoulder pain.

# Questions

1. Discuss how you would go about evaluating this patient.
2. On physical examination, your patient appears to have pain in the posterior lateral aspect of the shoulder joint. There is a restriction of range of motion due to the pain. The patient has flaccid tone and a 2 fingerbreadth subluxation of the humerus from the glenoid. Discuss management of this patient’s shoulder pain.
3. The patient and his family would like to know how subluxation happens and how you would manage it. How are you going to explain this to the family?
4. The patient has completed inpatient rehabilitation and is seeing you in the outpatient clinic 1 month later. His subluxation is now 1 fingerbreadth, but he now has a new burning pain in the shoulder, right hand, and wrist. He has developed some tone in his upper limb, but no significant spasticity. You note swelling, mottled skin, and allodynia. What might be causing this new pain?
5. He returns to your clinic 4 weeks later, and his pain is no better despite physical therapy with mirror therapy, contrast baths, and gentle range of motion. Discuss the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in stroke.
6. Gabapentin and prednisone have been largely ineffective in controlling his pain, and a stellate ganglion block did not help either. You are considering starting oxycodone in the short term to allow the patient to better participate in his physical therapy. What are considerations in doing this?

# CASE 2: UPPER LIMB PAIN IN STROKE

Answers

1.  As part of history taking, pe patient needs to be asked how pe pain began,
its quality and severity, and if pere are exacerbating and relieving factors. The
treating physician needs to know wheper pe patient had a previous injury or
trauma to pat shoulder joint, or if pere was pre-existing arpritic type shoulder pain. The history taking should focus on possible previous rotator cuff
injuries as well. On examination, one has to look for a positive Neer's test,
worse shoulder pain wip pe hand behind pe neck maneuver, restriction in
passive external rotation at pe shoulder joint, evidence of flaccidity versus
spasticity, shoulder impingement syndrome, or restriction in range of motion
due to pain or weakness. Also look for evidence of subluxation of pe shoulder.

2.  Management should start wip careful positioning of pe shoulder to minimize
subluxation. This could include a sling if pere is significant flaccidity in pe
upper extremity, and adhesive taping across pe shoulder joint. The perapist
can provide gentle range of motion exercises. If pe patient does not have
any contraindications, you can use local analgesic creams and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories. Many studies have shown improvement in subluxation
wip perapeutic electrical stimulation, while in oper studies pere was no
significant difference.

3.  One has to explain pe situation in lay terms. Diagrams are helpful. Shoulder
subluxation is characterized by a palpable gap between pe acromion and
humeral head. During pe flaccid period of stroke, pe rotator cuff sleeve is
not able to maintain pe humeral head in pe glenoid, and pe scapula is
downward rotated, predisposing to subluxation. Improper positioning in
bed, lack of support when upright, or pulling on pe arm during transfers can
cause subluxation.

4.  The patient probably meets pe International Association for Study of Pain
(IASP) criteria for CRPS type 1. CRPS type 1 occurs in about 25% of hemiplegic
patients wip associated spasticity of pe involved upper extremity. Lesions
of pe pre-motor area of pe brain especially are associated wip CRPS; its
etiology still remains unknown. It presents initially wip pain in pe shoulder
followed by painful movements of pe wrist and hand. There is hypersensitivity
to touch and stiffness of pe joints/decreased range of motion, wip painful
flexion of pe wrist and joints of pe hand. The pain and edema subside spontaneously in pe vast majority of patients in a few weeks.

5.  Treatment of CRPS in stroke is controversial and pe scientific evidence is
sparse. CRPS can be treated wip short courses of steroids, such as prednisone, based on small case series and trials. This appears to have better
effect when given early in pe course, before 13 weeks from onset. Though
pe mechanism of action is not known, calcitonin intranasally and clodronate
and alendronate have been shown to reduce pe pain of CRPS. Gabapentin
has been shown to be effective in type I CRPS in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial. There are no good studies to support use of NSAIDs.

and opioids, but they can be tried as an adjunctive treatment. Modalities such as to heat and cold, hand desensitization, and/or mirror therapy may be beneficial. If persistent, stellate ganglion sympathetic block can be considered. The last resort is sympathectomy, with best effect if done within 12 months of onset. To prevent it from getting worse, therapists have to avoid aggressive therapy and carefully position the shoulder with support. The course of CRPS is variable even with treatment, and it may persist for many years.

6. You should screen the patient for risk factors for substance abuse. Ensure that the family will lock up his medications. The most common reason for emergency visits from opioid overdose is family members using a patient’s medication. Have them sign an opioid use agreement, which indicates only one physician can prescribe the medication and prohibits early refills. Perform a drug screen before starting. Many practitioners prescribe a dose of naloxone rescue medicine along with the opioid prescription to prevent overdose.

CASE 3: DYSPHAGIA

A 72-year-old male is admitted in the inpatient rehabilitation unit with left-sided hemiparesis and cognitive slowing. He had a past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and has been placed on medications for secondary stroke prevention. Your nurse indicates that the patient has low-grade fever of 99.6° F with mild tachycardia, and was seen to cough while having his breakfast.

# Questions

1. How will you go about evaluating this patient?
2. The speech therapist recommended a modified barium swallow study after the bedside swallow test, and has found the patient has oropharyngeal dysphagia. What are the factors that predispose a stroke patient to aspirate?
3. Your patient’s family asks you about the prevalence of dysphagia and the risks associated with dysphagia of acute stroke. Discuss the advice you would give the patient and his family.
4. The resident physician working with you asks what strategies are included in the management of dysphagia. Discuss the best practice guidelines in dysphagia management.
5. What is the current understanding of the benefit of transcutaneous electrical stimulation in the treatment of dysphagia?

# STROKE REHABILITATION

# CASE 3: DYSPHAGIA

Answers
1. Fever in pe stroke patient may be from atelectasis, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia in pe acute rehabilitation time frame. While instituting incentive spirometry, pe physiatrist has to order a urinalysis and be vigilant for symptoms and signs of an aspiration pneumonia. This is especially true if pe patient has evidence of dysphagia. If pe stroke patient has productive cough and labs show leukocytosis, a chest x-ray is indicated. As part of pe initial evaluation of pe stroke, it is a Joint Commission Standard for stroke patients and best practice to get a swallow screen prior to any oral intake such as food, fluid, or medications. You can ask for a speech perapy consultation as part of pe evaluation to include a bedside swallow test. Cough reflex testing (CRT) along wip water swallow test has high sensitivity and specificity to detect dysphagia. The speech perapist will be able to make an assessment wheper pe patient needs instrumental evaluation; examples are fiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallow (FEES) or videofluoroscopic modified barium swallow (VMBS), wip pe latter considered pe gold standard in pe diagnosis of aspiration.
2. The main factors pat affect pe stroke patient’s ability to safely handle secretions and food are severity of pe stroke, location of pe stroke in pe pontine-medullary region, decreased level of consciousness, cognitive deficits, mobility of pe stroke patient, and weak voice and cough. Acidity of pe aspirate and also poor oral hygiene are seen to increase pe risk of aspiration pneumonia. Dysphagia diets, consisting of textured–modified solid foods and partially pickened liquids, may help to reduce pe incidence of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Between 29% and 67% of stroke patients have associated dysphagia and half of pem will develop aspiration. One study found pat 67% of stroke patients aspirate silently, which is defined as “penetration or food below pe level of pe true vocal cords, wipout cough or any outward sign of difficulty” (Linden, Siebens 1983). About 37% of patients who aspirate go on to develop a pneumonia. Aspiration can be detected by a congested voice quality, cough during or after swallowing, or a delay in voluntary initiation of pe swallow reflex. Dysphagia is also associated wip dehydration and consequent hypotension, especially when pe stroke patient has to drink only honey- or nectar-pick liquids. Dysphagia can lead to malnutrition. Studies showed pat it is associated wip increased lengp of stay during acute hospitalization and increased institutionalization. Administration of medications is especially challenging in a stroke patient wip dysphagia.
4. Suspected patients wip dysphagia should be maintained NPO until swallowing status is determined. The speech-language papologist can recommend an appropriate individualized dysphagia program including appropriate diet. The treating team should monitor hydration status closely, since studies showed pat patients wip texture-modified dysphagia diets received only

43% of the estimated fluid requirements over the first 21 days post stroke while hospitalized. Regular oral care before each meal helps limit buildup of bacteria. A dietitian can help to assess risk factors of poor nutrition and make recommendations to improve compliance also. The stroke patient with dysphagia should be fed from a seated position, at a slow rate of feeding, ensuring that swallow has taken place before offering additional food or liquid. Limited evidence indicates that a chin-down position prevents aspiration in about 50% of patients who are known aspirators. Position the patient comfortably upright for at least 30 minutes after each meal.

5. Electrical stimulation is widely used in the United States as an adjunct to conventional swallow therapy, but there is conflicting evidence that it can improve swallowing function post stroke. While some studies indicate improvement in the functional oral intake scale (FOIS) scores and fewer episodes of aspiration, others show no change in pharyngeal transit time or aspiration severity.

ABSTRACT

Objectives To identify common recommendations for high-quality care for the most common musculoskeletal (MSK) pain sites encountered by clinicians in emergency and primary care (spinal (lumbar, thoracic and cervical), hip/knee (including osteoarthritis [OA] and shoulder) from contemporary, high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Design Systematic review, critical appraisal and narrative synthesis of MSK pain CPG recommendations.

Eligibility criteria Included MSK pain CPGs were written in English, rated as high quality, published from 2011, focused on adults and described development processes. Excluded CPGs were for: traumatic MSK pain, single modalities (eg, surgery), traditional healing/medicine, specific disease processes (eg, inflammatory arthropathies) or those that required payment.

Data sources Four scientific databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Physiotherapy Evidence Database) and four guideline repositories.

Results 6232 records were identified, 44 CPGs were appraised and 11 were rated as high quality (low back pain: 4, OA: 4, neck: 2 and shoulder: 1). We identified 11 recommendations for MSK pain care: ensure care is patient centred, screen for red flag conditions, assess psychosocial factors, use imaging selectively, undertake a physical examination, monitor patient progress, provide education/information, address physical activity/exercise, use manual therapy only as an adjunct to other treatments, offer high-quality non-surgical care prior to surgery and try to keep patients at work.

Conclusion These 11 recommendations guide healthcare consumers, clinicians, researchers and policy makers to manage MSK pain. This should improve the quality of care of MSK pain.

BACKGROUND

Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions are the biggest cause of disability internationally and a major societal burden. One contributor to this burden, which is becoming increasingly recognised, is poor quality healthcare.

Common healthcare problems for MSK pain are summarised and include overuse of radiological imaging, surgery and opioids and a failure to provide patients with education and advice.

# Review

Box 1 Summary of common problems in musculoskeletal (MSK) pain care

|Overuse of imaging:|between 25% and 42% of patients with low back pain (LBP) undergo imaging even though its routine use is discouraged and associated with harms. Sixty-nine per cent of general practitioners would refer patients for radiography at first presentation of rotator cuff tendinopathy and 82% would refer for ultrasound, despite findings demonstrating a poor relationship of imaging findings with symptoms.|
|---|---|
|Overuse of surgery:|knee arthroscopy for knee osteoarthritis is not recommended, yet its rate of use in the general US population increased from 3% to 4% from 2006 to 2010. The rates of shoulder subacromial decompression and rotator cuff repair have increased markedly even though surgical outcomes are comparable with exercise-based rehabilitation or sham surgery.|
|Overuse of opioids:|the efficacy of opioids for MSK pain management is questionable for both chronic and acute MSK pain conditions. The early use of opioids has been associated with poorer outcomes in LBP care. Although limiting the use of opioids is recommended, there is increasing use and an 'epidemic' of prescription opioid-related harms.|
|Failure to provide education and advice:|these are cornerstones of managing MSK pain conditions, yet only 20% of patients with LBP were given advice and education in a primary care setting.|

# Appraisal

Three investigators (IL, LW and RW) independently appraised the quality of CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument. The AGREE II instrument is the most widely used generic instrument to measure the development and reporting of CPGs and has acceptably high construct validity.

# Analysis

Using AGREE PLUS on the AGREE II website individual item scores, domain scores and overall AGREE II scores were calculated for each CPG. Inter-rater agreement was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with a two-way random effects model for each domain and overall rating scores.

# Synthesis and identifying consistent recommendations

Synthesis consisted of four stages: extracting CPG recommendations, classifying recommendations, developing a narrative summary and, where possible, identifying consistent/common recommendations across MSK conditions. We also identified common recommendations within each MSK pain condition.

# Methods

We undertook a systematic review and synthesis of contemporary MSK pain CPGs for three of the most common MSK pain sites: spinal pain (lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine), hip/knee pain including hip/knee OA and shoulder pain. The methods, including search strategy and selection processes, have been previously published. We selected CPGs published within 5 years of the original search date (since 2011).

# CPG synthesis and identifying consistent recommendations

Recommendations from high-quality CPGs were extracted independently by two reviewers (IL and either RW or LW).

# Table 1

|Recommendation classification|Definition|Examples of terminology|
|---|---|---|
|'Should do'|'Should do' recommendations were those that should be applied in all circumstances unless there is a rationale not to. These were based on strong evidence, for example, multiple high-quality studies reporting clinically relevant positive effects, benefits that outweigh risks or when in the opinion of CPG development group members that the benefits were unequivocal.|'Strong recommendation', for example, 'offer' and 'should' occur.|
|'Could do'|'Could do' recommendations could be applied depending on the circumstances of individual patients. They were usually based on consistent evidence from multiple lesser quality studies or one high quality study and where benefits outweigh harms.|'Considered', for example, 'may include', 'recommend', 'practitioner might' and 'suggest'.|
|'Do not do'|'Do not do' recommendations applied when there was strong evidence of no benefit and/or harms outweighing benefits. Two CPGs provided strong and weak 'do not do' recommendations that were combined for the purposes of our review.|'Do not offer', for example, 'should refrain from', 'do not routinely offer', 'not appropriate' and 'should not'.|
|'Uncertain'|'Uncertain' applied when there was no recommendation for or against a practice, because of incomplete or inconsistent research findings. Not all CPGs provided uncertain recommendations.|'Inconclusive' or 'we are unable to recommend for or against', 'inconclusive evidence' or 'uncertain'.|

The evidence supporting each recommendation, as reported by each CPG, was recorded (eg, level of evidence and strength of recommendation). Extracted recommendations were compared and discrepancies resolved through discussion and consensus.

# RESULTS

Our searches, including an updated search, identified 6232 discrete records, from which 44 CPGs (34 CPGs initial search and 10 CPGs updated search) were selected for inclusion. Fifteen of the included CPGs were for LBP, 14 were for OA, 6 for shoulder conditions and 5 for the neck. We included single CPGs for the neck/thoracic spine, knee, 'musculoskeletal injuries' and lower limb.

# Characteristics of included CPGs

With the exception of CPGs from Malaysia and the Philippines, all CPGs originated or involved panel members from high-income countries. CPGs were from 11 individual countries and 'international' collaborations, involving authors from multiple countries. Most were from the USA, 'international' and Canada. The Netherlands, UK and Italy each contributed two CPGs.

# Appraisal of CPGs: inter-rater agreement

Inter-rater agreement was 'fair' for scope and purpose (domain 1), 'good' for clarity of presentation (domain 4) and 'excellent' for all other domains and overall AGREE II score.

# Appraisal of CPGs: quality

The mean (SD) AGREE II scores for each item, domain and overall scores across all guidelines are displayed in online supplementary file 3. The domain with the lowest mean score was 'Applicability' (27.6%, SD=18.3), and the highest mean score was for 'Scope and Purpose' (73.7%, SD=13.8).

In our previous review, eight high-quality MSK pain CPGs were identified for OA, LBP, and shoulder pain. Of the 10 additional CPGs identified in our updated search, three were rated as high-quality.

Radiological imaging is discouraged unless: (1) serious pathology is suspected, (2) there has been an unsatisfactory response to conservative care or unexplained progression of signs and symptoms or (3) imaging is likely to change management

If used, manual therapy should be applied only in conjunction with other treatments
---
However when included, manual therapy was consistently recommended as a component of multimodal care, in conjunction with other management strategies, including exercise, psychological therapy, information/education, and activity advice rather than a stand-alone treatment.

Unless specifically contraindicated (eg, ‘red flag’ condition[s]), offer evidence-informed non-surgical care prior to surgery Four CPGs recommended that patients be provided non-surgical treatments prior to consideration of surgery. The CPG for rotator cuff disorders was the only to specify a trial duration for non-surgical care, recommending surgical review if 3 months of non-surgical management had been unsuccessful and/or following non-surgical care there was a symptomatic full thickness rotator cuff tear on review.

Facilitate continuation or resumption of work Five CPGs offered a ‘should do’ recommendation for re-engagement with or continuation of work for patients with MSK pain, including neck pain, OA, rotator cuff syndrome, and LBP. One CPG for LBP offered a ‘could do’ recommendation to advise patients to stay active, avoid inactivity and gradually increase activity levels, including work involvement. CPGs emphasized early return to work including engagement with vocational rehabilitation services, communication between worker, employer and health provider and planning processes to facilitate return to work.

Single MSK conditions and conflicting recommendations We also identified common recommendations for single MSK pain conditions including seven for LBP, four for OA and one for NAD.

Consistent recommendations wipin single musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions
Osteoarpritis (OA)
Offer self-management programmes.
Provide interventions targeting weight loss to people wip OA who are overweight or obese.
Do not use glucosamine or chondroitin for disease modification.
Do not undertake knee arproscopic lavage and debridement unless pere is a rationale (such as mechanical knee locking).
Low back pain
Do not offer paracetamol as a single medication.
Do not offer opioids for chronic LBP.
Do not offer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants for LBP.
Do not offer rocker shoes or foot orpotics.
Do not offer disc replacement.
Only offer spinal fusion if part of a randomised controlled trial.
Spinal injections (eg, facet joint injections, medical branch blocks, intradiscal injections, proloperapy and trigger point injections) should not be used for LBP.
Neck pain
Neck pain disorders should be classified as grades I–IV.

Conflicting recommendations for CPGs both between MSK pain conditions and within CPGs for a specific condition were noted for medication prescription (including paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), electrotherapy, the use of braces and orthoses and acupuncture. There were also conflicting recommendations regarding the prescription of opioids including ‘could do’, ‘do not do’ and ‘uncertain’ recommendations. CPGs that offered ‘could do’ recommendations advocated caution, including careful consideration of risk and benefits, possible use of opioids ‘for the shortest period.

DISCUSSION We identified 11 common recommendations for MSK pain care that applied to patients with OA, LBP, neck pain and shoulder pain. These recommendations may provide clinicians, healthcare managers, funders, policy makers and researchers with a simple and clear consensus of current MSK pain priorities. In turn, this could help address the variable quality of clinical care delivered for MSK pain conditions. The common recommendations could be used in a number of ways to improve care. First, they could guide consumers in making informed healthcare decisions or assist them to identify when they are receiving suboptimal care. Second, clinicians could apply the recommendations to guide care decision making, to identify areas for learning and development and to assess their practice. Third, health services could assess the quality of care by applying them as minimum standards during clinical audit. Finally, a broader strategy (eg, for researchers, health planners/policy makers or funders) could be the continued development of the common recommendations into a set of quality indicators that could be used for reporting or to benchmark care quality. The recommendations could be used as a preliminary set of standards that could be refined via a rigorous, structured process. Our findings are similar to a recent review by Babatunde et al that recommended care included self-management advice, education and exercise as first-line treatments for MSK pain. The authors recommended short-term NSAIDs and opioids for pain relief provided risks and harms were considered. There was limited evidence for aids and devices (eg, taping and braces) and passive treatments (eg, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and laser) and inconsistent evidence for surgery (equivalent to conservative care options in the longer term). In contrast to our review, the authors reported support for psychosocial interventions, especially for those at risk of poor prognosis. We found that while CPGs in our review universally recommended psychosocial assessment, only LBP and neck pain CPGs reported on psychological treatments (‘could do’ recommendations for psychological therapies for LBP and contradictory recommendations for neck pain). Although our review included more recent CPGs, for example, CPGs for other common MSK pain conditions including OA and hip pain, Babatunde et al included other sources of literature such as trials and systematic reviews. Psychological-informed management for MSK pain is an area that is currently lacking in CPGs. Our review identified CPGs for LBP, OA, NAD and rotator cuff disorders. Arguably the common recommendations are relevant to other MSK pain conditions. For example, in tendinopathy, psychosocial factors are known predictors of outcome; radiological imaging is of questionable clinical utility because of a moderate relationship between symptoms and outcome, and high value non-surgical approaches to management such as education and exercise form the cornerstones of care. Although high-quality

# Review

CPGs are currently lacking for other MSK pain conditions, we speculate that the consistent recommendations could be applied broadly to managing non-traumatic MSK pain.

Due to the potential for harm, an area we were interested in was opioid prescribing. We were unable to identify a consensus among CPGs relating to opioids, and there were conflicting recommendations both within and across MSK pain conditions. While there were conflicting views, almost all CPGs urged caution and/or discouraged opioid use. Recent research has reported no additional benefit of an opioid over a NSAID for acute LBP and further efficacy studies are underway. Recent opioid-prescribing CPGs for patients with chronic pain recommend risk assessment to identify those at higher likelihood of opioid-related harms. Although outside the scope of this review, these recommendations should be considered by clinicians in emergency care. Our findings were similar to recent reviews of LBP management.

In emergency care, clinicians should use 'red flags' to assess the likelihood of serious pathology, apply judicious use of radiological imaging, identify psychosocial risk factors, provide targeted education and reassurance, offer exercise, cold and heat and promote early return to work and function. The similarities of these recommendations and our findings suggest they could be applied in varied healthcare settings.

Results of our updated search reinforced our previous findings that most MSK pain CPGs were of poor quality, which is a waste of resources. In addition to directing resources to fewer, higher quality CPGs, another way to reduce waste is for developers to focus on gaps in recommendations, areas for which there is currently limited consensus, and on other MSK pain conditions. CPGs targeting thoracic pain and non-OA knee pain are MSK pain areas that are lacking.

# Limitations

The AGREE II instrument reflects methodological processes, not necessarily content, and scores may reflect reporting rather than methodological quality. The AGREE II developer’s suggest research groups identify their own criteria for CPG quality. Our group defined high-quality CPGs as those who scored higher than 50% in three AGREE II domains. Although consistent with the AGREE II developer’s recommendations, investigator-developed criteria have the potential for bias by including or excluding CPGs based on non-empirically derived criteria. While a cut-off value of 50% is consistent with other studies, for example, with some other reviewers for example. CPGs were appraised by three authors and ideally four should be used. Our research group was interprofessional; CPG appraisers were academic and clinical physiotherapists (IL and RW) and an indicator development researcher also with a background in physiotherapy (LW).

Our synopsis of CPGs and interpretation of their recommendations (eg, as ‘should do’, ‘could do’ and so on), due to variations in the reporting and language of CPGs, relied on the interpretation of the research group. This is an inherent issue where there is heterogeneity in the way CPGs are conceptualised and their recommendations and underpinning evidence are presented. For example, some CPGs offer broad generalised recommendations compared with others that address specific, highly targeted questions. To account for this, we have ensured our interpretation and methodological steps have been clearly reported. As always, the search strategy may have failed to identify all relevant.

# Conclusion

Variation in the quality of care is a barrier to providing high value MSK pain care. CPGs are an important tool to address MSK pain care quality. We identified 11 consistent recommendations for the management of MSK pain conditions. These recommendations can be used by consumers, clinicians and at health services and policy levels to improve the quality of MSK pain care. Optimising the implementation of these recommendations comprises the next challenge.

# Summary

• Chaotic and irregular atrial arrhythmia, the prevalence of which increases progressively with age.

• Patients frequently have co-existing cardiac or non-cardiac conditions, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular disease, heart failure, obesity, and sleep apnoea or pulmonary disease.

• Causes significant morbidity (e.g., palpitations, dyspnoea, angina, dizziness or syncope, and features of heart failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or stroke) and death. Many patients are asymptomatic or have symptoms that are less specific for cardiac arrhythmias, such as mild dementia or silent strokes.

• ECG shows absent P waves, presence of fibrillatory waves, and irregularly irregular QRS complexes.

• Treatment strategy depends on the severity of symptoms, the duration of AF, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Treatment involves correction of the abnormal rate, or rate plus rhythm, along with anticoagulation in high-risk patients.

• Risks and benefits of a chosen therapy, such as rate control or rhythm control strategies utilising beta-blockers, calcium blockers, digoxin, anti-arrhythmic agents, catheter-based or surgical ablation for pulmonary vein isolation and left atrial substrate modification, pacemakers, and ablation of the atrioventricular node need to be weighed based on multiple clinical factors to optimise patient outcome.

# BASICS

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

Definition

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. It is characterised by uncoordinated atrial activity on the surface ECG, with fibrillatory waves of varying shapes, amplitudes, and timing associated with an irregularly irregular ventricular response when atrioventricular conduction is intact.

Epidemiology

AF carries an overall population prevalence of 0.5% to 1.0% and an incidence of 0.54 cases per 1000 person-years. The prevalence of AF is highly age-dependent. The prevalence increases with age, from 0.5% at 40 to 50 years, to 5% to 15% at 80 years. Men are more often affected than women. The Rotterdam study found that the lifetime risk of developing AF at 55 years old was 24% in men and 22% in women. The prevalence of AF has a male predisposition, affecting men 1.5 times more commonly than women. In the Framingham and Rotterdam studies, after adjustment for age and other risk factors, AF occurrence was greater in men than in women but occurrence was similar in other analyses. The Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly (SAFE) project reported that the baseline prevalence of AF in participants aged over 65 years was 7.2%, with a higher prevalence in men (7.8%) and people aged 75 years or older, with an incidence of 0.69% to 1.64% per year, depending on screening method. These incidence data refer to cross-sectional study data whereby most people would have AF lasting &gt;7 days (persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent AF) rather than acute AF. In the UK, the prevalence of AF is 0.5% to 1.0% and incidence is 0.54 cases per 1000 person-years. The prevalence and incidence of AF in non-white populations is less well studied.

Aetiology

Chronic AF is associated with all types of cardiac disease, as well as many non-cardiac conditions. In resource-rich settings, the most common associated clinical diagnoses are hypertension, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. Congestive heart failure, hypertension, and rheumatic valvular disease are leading associated conditions in resource-poor settings. The presence of diastolic or systolic cardiac failure increases the risk. Other cardiac aetiologies of chronic AF include:

- Atrial and ventricular dilation or hypertrophy
- Electrophysiological abnormalities (e.g., sick sinus syndrome)
- Congenital heart disease
- Cardiac or juxtacardiac benign or malignant, primary, or metastatic tumours
- Inflammatory or infiltrative disease (e.g., pericarditis, amyloidosis, myocarditis)
- Age-induced atrial and ventricular fibrosis

Non-cardiac conditions that are associated with chronic AF include:

- Thyroid disease
- Autonomic neuronal dysfunction
- Alcohol and caffeine abuse
- Non-cardiac pulmonary hypertension
- Infections

In rare cases, chronic AF may be familial or genetic, such as in familial cardiomyopathy.

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

# Basics

# Pathophysiology

Since its early description, several theories have evolved in our current understanding of pathophysiologies of AF. Pathophysiology of AF involves multiple aetiologies and complex electrophysiological changes. AF is usually associated with anatomically and histologically abnormal atria as a result of underlying heart disease. Dilation of the atria with fibrosis and inflammation causes a difference in refractory periods within the atrial tissue and promotes electrical re-entry that results in AF. The fractionation of a mother wave into multiple wavelets in the presence of enlarged atria, in conjunction with the short refractory periods and slow conduction properties of the atria, lead to sustained AF. The presence of rapidly firing foci, typically in the pulmonary veins, may trigger AF, and this is sustained by fibrillatory conduction or multiple re-entrant circuits. Clinical cardiovascular disease entities, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, and coronary disease, through mechanisms such as myocardial stretch and fibrosis with disruption in cell-to-cell coupling, can lead to triggers and cellular and electrical remodelling that may promote AF.

# Classification

The practice guidelines for the management of patients with AF developed by the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society classify AF into the following types:

|Paroxysmal AF:|defined as recurrent (>1 episode ≥30 seconds in duration) AF that terminates spontaneously within 7 days|
|---|---|
|Persistent AF:|defined as AF that is sustained >7 days or lasts <7 days but necessitates pharmacological or electrical cardioversion|
|Long-standing persistent AF:|a sub-group of persistent AF, defined as continuous AF >1 year in duration|
|Permanent AF:|refractory to cardioversion or accepted as a final rhythm. A decision has been made not to pursue restoration of sinus rhythm by any means, including catheter or surgical ablation|
|Chronic AF:|may be paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent|
|Acute AF:|is a new-onset, or a first detectable, episode of AF, whether symptomatic or not.|

The term 'lone AF' applies to patients <60 years of age without echocardiographic or clinical evidence of cardiac, pulmonary, or circulatory disease. However, because definitions are variable, the term 'lone AF' is potentially confusing and should not be used to guide therapeutic decisions.

# PREVENTION

|Chronic atrial fibrillation|Prevention|
|---|---|
|Primary prevention| |
|ACE inhibitors, statins, and specific dietary lipid components present in certain types of fish have been shown to reduce the incidence of AF.[44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] Preoperative treatment with a beta-blocker or amiodarone reduces postoperative incidence of AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or in patients at high risk for AF.[2] [4]| |

Screening

Stroke may be the initial presentation of AF. Studies evaluating patients with a first-ever ischaemic stroke have found the prevalence of AF to be 15% to 25%.[3] [4] Furthermore, studies assessing prolonged ECG monitoring (using a 30-day event-triggered recorder or an insertable cardiac monitoring device) in patients with cryptogenic stroke have found AF to be common in these patients.[50] [51] Therefore, strategies for primary preventative screening for AF in patients at high risk of stroke can be considered. There is no expert consensus or guideline recommendation on screening patients with asymptomatic AF. However, screening for AF can be performed in patients implanted with a pacemaker or defibrillator. In an observational study involving patients receiving an implantable pacemaker, new-onset AF and long-term AF burden were frequently observed in patients with heart block or sinus node disease, but were significantly more predominant in patients with sinus node disease.[59]

Secondary prevention

Weight reduction with intensive risk factor management has been shown to reduce atrial fibrillation symptom burden and severity, and result in beneficial cardiac remodelling.[135]

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

# Diagnosis

# Case history

A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and prior myocardial infarction presents to the emergency department with palpitations and shortness of breath. These symptoms started 2 days ago. She was diagnosed to have AF with rapid ventricular rate response a year and a half ago, at which time an attempted direct current cardioversion and a trial of sotalol to maintain sinus rhythm and prevent further episodes of AF were unsuccessful. The patient was treated with digoxin and metoprolol to control rate and warfarin to prevent stroke. Current physical examination shows that she is febrile and has an irregularly irregular radial pulse at a rate between 90 and 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are irregular, but no S3 or S4 gallop or murmurs are audible. The breath sounds are of bronchial character associated with crepitations over left basal lung area.

# Other presentations

In an older patient the symptoms may be as subtle as a decrease in mentation or listlessness. In others the first symptom may be syncope, cardiac arrest, stroke, or congestive heart failure.

# Step-by-step diagnostic approach

Patients with chronic AF may present with typical symptoms (e.g., palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, dizziness), complications of AF (e.g., stroke), or associated conditions (e.g., features of thyroid disease), or they may be asymptomatic. An ECG usually confirms the diagnosis. Further investigations include baseline laboratory blood tests and echocardiogram.

# Clinical presentation

The most common presenting symptoms of chronic AF are palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, dizziness, and symptoms associated with stroke. AF can cause a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy resulting in symptoms of congestive heart failure. In some cases, due to the rapidity of the ventricular response, cerebral hypoperfusion can result in presyncope or syncope. About 12% to 20% of patients with AF may be asymptomatic. In these patients, AF may be incidentally detected during a health check or following an acute complication, such as stroke. The prevalence of AF in patients with a first-ever ischaemic stroke has been found to be around 15% to 25%.

The past medical and surgical history may be significant for all types of cardiac disease (such as valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy, and other arrhythmias), including recent cardiothoracic surgery, as well as for many non-cardiac conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disease, and cancer.

DIAGNOSIS

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Diagnosis

Class 2b (moderate): normal daily activity not affected by symptoms related to AF, but patient troubled by symptoms
Class 3 (severe): normal daily activity affected by symptoms related to AF
Class 4 (disabling): normal daily activity discontinued.

Physical examination

The pulse may be irregularly irregular and rapid but, depending on where the pulse is taken, decreased perfusion may cause an underestimation of these findings.[1] [2] [13] Palpation of the carotids or auscultation may be necessary. An apparently palpable regular pulse does not exclude AF. It can be extremely difficult to appreciate irregularity if the pulse rate is very rapid or very slow. The latter may occur in patients with very poor atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction due to intrinsic AV nodal disease or AV nodal blocking drugs. In patients with digitalis toxicity, a junctional rhythm may be present in the face of AF. An apparently irregular pulse does not always indicate AF: for example, other causes of irregular pulse are frequent premature atrial and/or ventricular complexes in the presence of sinus rhythm, atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter. It is therefore necessary to confirm the rhythm with an ECG. Other findings may include irregular jugular venous pulsations, variation in the intensity of the first heart sound, or absence of a fourth sound heard previously during sinus rhythm.

There may be physical findings consistent with an underlying cause of AF, such as features of heart failure, stroke, or an endocrinological problem, such as hyperthyroidism. In an older patient the symptoms may be as subtle as a decrease in mentation or listlessness.

12-lead ECG

An ECG is performed in all patients with possible AF, and is usually confirmatory. P waves are absent and are replaced by rapid fibrillatory waves, which vary in size, shape, and timing, leading to an irregular ventricular response when AV conduction is intact.

[Fig-1]

[Fig-2]

Low-amplitude P waves, such as in an atrial tachycardia, especially multifocal atrial tachycardia that may be observed in patients with COPD, may mimic AF. In patients with permanent pacemakers, underlying AF on ECG may be missed especially in the presence of rapid-paced ventricular rate. Inconsistent premature atrial contractions can impart an irregular ventricular rhythm that at times may be called AF by the ECG diagnostic algorithms.

Other rhythms that need to be excluded are counterclockwise atrial flutter, clockwise atrial flutter, and multifocal atrial tachycardia. Where diagnostic uncertainty remains, the use of 24-hour (or even 7-day) Holter monitoring or an event recorder (e.g., Cardiomemo) may also be required.[13]

[Fig-3]

[Fig-4]

Echocardiography

Transthoracic echocardiogram may be performed after the 12-lead ECG and is important to exclude important cardiac pathologies and risk factors for persistent AF, such as valvular and pericardial disease and cardiomyopathies.[1] [2] Furthermore, it can suggest left atrial thrombus. However, absence of thrombi in the left atrium by a transthoracic echocardiogram does not rule them out. In order to exclude

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

Diagnosis

For patients with left atrial thrombi, it is necessary to conduct a trans-oesophageal echocardiogram for accurate detection, rather than a transthoracic echocardiogram. Prior to cardioversion, patients with an unknown or suboptimal anticoagulation profile should undergo a trans-oesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial thrombus.

Laboratory evaluation

Thyroid function tests should be performed for all patients with chronic AF. Hyperthyroidism can be identified through laboratory tests and managed with medication, radioablative therapy, or surgery. Diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis is crucial when controlling the ventricular rate becomes challenging. Additionally, routine biochemistry tests including serum urea, electrolytes, serum magnesium, and liver transaminases are recommended to evaluate comorbid conditions, electrolyte levels, and metabolic status. These tests aid in selecting appropriate anti-arrhythmic agents and dosages.

Risk factors

Strong hypertension

- Strongly associated with the development of AF, with a greater than fourfold increase compared to controls in the Framingham study. The lifetime risk does not appear to vary with different blood pressure values. The mechanisms are likely linked to the impact of pressure and myocardial stretch on the electrophysiological properties in the atrial muscle.

Coronary artery disease

- The presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) doubles the risk of AF development according to the Framingham study. This may be attributed to scar formation post-myocardial infarction. The heightened AF risk in CAD patients is mainly due to concomitant left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Congestive heart failure

- A potent predictor of AF occurrence, diagnosed in up to 35% of patients, potentially being an underestimate. It was a significant independent predictor in the Framingham study. The mechanisms are associated with atrial stretch-mediated effects.

Advancing age

- Prevalence significantly rises with age for both genders, doubling after the age of 50 years.

Diabetes mellitus

- Positively correlated with AF risk in both genders.

# DIAGNOSIS

Chronic atrial fibrillation
Diagnosis

rheumatic valvular disease

- Strong association with rheumatic heart disease, especially mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation. The 2-year age-adjusted risk ranged from 7.6 to 9.9 for men and 24.3 to 27.5 for women in the Framingham study.

alcohol abuse

- Excessive amounts acutely or moderate amounts over a long period, particularly if associated with a cardiomyopathy, may cause AF (hazard ratio 1.45 among men who consume ≥35 alcoholic drinks per week). The links are variably reported but several studies suggest a relationship. It can also be seen with withdrawal symptoms.

male sex

- In the Framingham study, after adjustment for age and other risk factors, AF occurrence is 1.5 times greater in men than in women, but occurrence is similar in other analyses.

presence of other arrhythmias

- AF may result as degeneration of other rapid arrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia and atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.

smoking

- Smoking is associated with the incidence of AF, with more than a twofold increased risk of AF attributed to current smoking.
- Among smokers who quit, there is a trend toward a lower incidence of AF compared with those who continue to smoke.
- In the large prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, participants were followed-up for over a mean of 13.1 years. Compared with never smokers, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for AF were 1.32 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.57) in former smokers, 2.05 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.47) in current smokers, and 1.58 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.85) in ever smokers. Associations were similar by sex, race, and type of AF. People who quit smoking exhibited a trend indicating a slightly lower risk of developing AF compared with those who continued to smoke.

Weak

thyroid disease

- About 10% to 15% of patients with untreated thyrotoxicosis develop AF.
- Suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone alone is a risk factor for AF. In the older population, hyperthyroidism may not be clinically evident (apathetic hyperthyroidism) and AF may be a clinical sign of this entity.

autonomic neuronal dysfunction

- Increased parasympathetic tone is linked to the occurrence of AF, as it heterogeneously reduces the atrial effective refractory period and predisposes to re-entry. Investigational drugs that block certain potassium channels regulated by acetylcholine suppressed AF in certain experimental models. Data from catheter ablation procedures suggest better long-term outcomes with denervation of parasympathetic ganglia near the pulmonary veins.

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

# Diagnosis

obesity and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)

# Obesity and the magnitude of nocturnal oxygen desaturation (an important pathophysiological consequence of OSA) are independent risk factors for incident AF in people aged <65 years.[40] Abdominal adiposity and higher body fat mass have also been shown to increase the risk of AF.[41] Use of continuous positive airway pressure in patients with OSA is associated with a reduced risk of recurrent AF after catheter ablation.[42]

caffeine abuse

Can be a risk factor in susceptible people.

cancer

- Especially primary lung cancer involving the pleura and pericardium, and cancers such as breast cancer and malignant melanoma metastasising to the pericardium.
- In addition, patients who have had radiotherapy to the mediastinum for cancers such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are prone to AF.

working long hours

One prospective multi-cohort study found that people who worked long hours (≥55 hours per week) were more likely to develop AF than those working standard hours (35-40 hours per week).[43]

# History & examination factors

# Key diagnostic factors

presence of risk factors (common)

- Key risk factors for AF include those of cardiovascular origin (e.g., coronary artery disease, hypertension, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy, and presence of other arrhythmias).
- Key risk factors also include non-cardiovascular conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, alcohol abuse, smoking, and certain cancers (e.g., primary lung cancer involving the pleura and pericardium; breast cancer and malignant melanoma metastasising to the pericardium; and following radiotherapy to the mediastinum for cancers such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).

palpitations (common)

Common symptom, although some patients are asymptomatic.

tachycardia (common)

Most patients have tachycardia if not already taking a rate-controlling medicine.

irregular pulse (common)

- Over 90% of patients with persistent AF have irregular pulse on palpation. However, an apparently regular pulse does not exclude AF. It can be extremely difficult to appreciate irregularity if the pulse rate is very rapid or very slow. The latter may occur in patients with very poor atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction due to intrinsic AV nodal disease or AV nodal blocking drugs.
- An apparently irregular pulse does not always indicate AF: for example, other causes of irregular pulse are frequent premature atrial and/or ventricular complexes in the presence of sinus rhythm, atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter. It is therefore necessary to confirm the rhythm with an ECG.

# DIAGNOSIS

|Chronic atrial fibrillation|Diagnosis|
|---|---|
|Other diagnostic factors|stroke (common)|

- As a complication of AF.
- Studies evaluating patients with a first-ever ischaemic stroke have found a high (15% to 25%) prevalence of AF.[3] [4]
- Studies assessing prolonged ECG monitoring (using a 30-day event-triggered recorder or an insertable cardiac monitoring device) in patients with cryptogenic stroke have found AF to be common in these patients.[50] [51]

- fatigue (uncommon)
- Patients may present with fatigue due to AF-related cardiomyopathy.

- chest pain (uncommon)
- Patients may present with anginal chest pain due to concomitant coronary artery disease.

- dizziness (uncommon)
- The reasons for dizziness are several. Due to loss of atrial kick and resultant decline in the stroke volume, patients with stiff ventricles and diastolic dysfunction in particular may experience dizziness.
- Patients may also develop dizziness due to thromboembolic events, or due to poor cerebral perfusion, especially if they have concomitant cerebrovascular disease.

- asymptomatic (uncommon)
- Around 12% to 20% of patients with AF may be asymptomatic.[1] [13] Asymptomatic presentation can be common with paroxysmal AF.

- hypotension (uncommon)
- AF with a rapid ventricular rate may cause haemodynamic instability.

- elevated jugular venous pressure (uncommon)
- A feature of associated heart failure.

- murmur or gallop rhythm (uncommon)
- Murmurs associated with underlying valvular disease, such as mitral stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease, may be audible. A gallop rhythm may be heard in heart failure.

- rales (uncommon)
- A feature of associated heart failure.

- decrease in mentation or listlessness (uncommon)
- In an older patient the symptoms may be as subtle as a decrease in mentation or listlessness.

# Diagnostic criteria

Risk factors for thromboembolism in patients with AF

The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation guidelines describe the rationale for using anticoagulation based on risk factors assessed by the CHADS or CHA2DS2-VASc score.

The following risk factors are generally considered for thromboembolism in patients with AF.

Less validated or weaker risk factors:

- Female sex
- Age 65-74 years
- Coronary artery disease
- Thyrotoxicosis

Moderate risk factors:

- Age 75 years or older

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

Diagnosis

- Hypertension
- Heart failure
- Left ventricular ejection fraction 35% or less
- Diabetes mellitus

High risk factors:

- Previous stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or embolism
- Mitral stenosis
- Prosthetic heart valve

CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system for risk of thromboembolism[1] [52]

In patients with AF and non-valvular (particularly rheumatic) heart disease, the risk of thromboembolic stroke may be estimated by computing score on the CHADS2 score system. The variables considered are congestive heart failure (C), hypertension (H), age (A), diabetes mellitus (D), and a history of stroke (S). Each variable is given 1 point, except the presence of a history of stroke or prior transient ischaemic attack (TIA), which is given 2 points. The validation of this scheme indicates low risk for CHADS2 score of 0; moderate risk for CHADS2 score of 1 to 2; and high risk for CHADS2 score of &gt;2 for future risks of thromboembolic stroke.

The stroke rate per 100 patient-years without antithrombotic therapy according to CHADS2 score is as follows:

|Score|Stroke risk|
|---|---|
|0|1.9% (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0)|
|1|2.8% (95% CI 2.0 to 3.8)|
|2|4.0% (95% CI 3.1 to 5.1)|
|3|5.9% (95% CI 4.6 to 7.3)|
|4|8.5% (95% CI 6.3 to 11.1)|
|5|12.5% (95% CI 8.2 to 17.5)|
|6|18.2% (95% CI 10.5 to 27.4)|

The CHADS2 score system is useful and easy to remember. However, because the risk of thromboembolic events is a continuum, categorisation of the risks into low, moderate, and high is rather artificial, especially taking only a few risk factors into account. The value of the CHADS2 scoring system in the risk stratification of patients with AF who undergo direct current cardioversion is unreliable, especially for patients with a low CHADS2 score.[53] The 2016 ESC guidelines emphasise a risk-factor-based approach using the CHA2DS2-VASc score system.[1] The CHA2DS2-VASc scheme is based on a point system in which 2 points are assigned for a history of stroke or TIA or ages 75 years or older; and 1 point each is assigned for ages 65 to 74 years; a history of hypertension, diabetes, recent cardiac failure, vascular disease (myocardial infarction, complex aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease [PAD], including prior revascularisation, amputation due to PAD, or angiographic evidence of PAD, etc.); and female sex.

Based on this system, the adjusted stroke rate (%/year) corresponding to CHA2DS2-VASc score is as follows:

|Score|Stroke rate|
|---|---|
|0|0%|
|1|1.3%|
|2|2.2%|
|3|3.2%|
|4|4.0%|

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Diagnosis

|Score 5:|stroke rate 6.7%|
|---|---|
|Score 6:|stroke rate 9.8%|
|Score 7:|stroke rate 9.6%|
|Score 8:|stroke rate 6.7%|
|Score 9:|stroke rate 15.2%.|

In one study, patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 (male) or 1 (female) were found to have a low risk for stroke and bleeding. However, with one additional stroke risk factor (e.g., CHA2DS2-VASc score = 1 [male plus a risk factor] or 2 [female plus another risk factor]) there was a significant increase in stroke event rate (3.01-fold) and mortality rate (3.12-fold) in non-anticoagulated patients.[54] [55]

HEMORR2HAGES score system[56]

In addition to consideration of the risk of stroke and benefit of anticoagulation therapy, the risk of haemorrhage (particularly intracranial) has to be considered. For patients taking warfarin, several scoring systems aim to stratify this risk of bleeding. In the HEMORR2HAGES score, points are assigned for each risk factor: hepatic or renal disease (H), ethanol abuse (E), malignancy (M), older age (>75 years) (O), reduced platelet count or function (R), re-bleeding risk (R), uncontrolled hypertension (H), anaemia (A), genetic factor (G), excessive fall risk (E), and stroke (S). One point is awarded for each risk factor, except for a prior bleed (re-bleeding risk), which is given 2 points.

Using this system, the risk of major bleeding in National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation participants prescribed warfarin, stratified by HEMORR2HAGES score, was as follows:

|Score 0:|1.9 (0.6 to 4.4) bleeds per 100 point-years warfarin (95% CI)|
|---|---|
|Score 1:|2.5 (1.3 to 4.3) bleeds per 100 point-years warfarin (95% CI)|
|Score 2:|5.3 (3.4 to 8.1) bleeds per 100 point-years warfarin (95% CI)|
|Score 3:|8.4 (4.9 to 13.6) bleeds per 100 point-years warfarin (95% CI)|
|Score 4:|10.4 (5.1 to 18.9) bleeds per 100 point-years warfarin (95% CI)|
|Score ≥5:|12.3 (5.8 to 23.1) bleeds per 100 point-years warfarin (95% CI)|

HAS-BLED[57]

HAS-BLED is a scoring system in which the clinical characteristics of hypertension (H), abnormal renal or hepatic function (A), stroke (S), bleeding or its risks (B), labile international normalised ratios (L), older age group (>65 years) (E), and drugs/alcohol (drugs such as antiplatelets) (D) are given 1 point each. Based on this scoring system, the risk of bleeding is significantly higher for scores ≥3.

ORBIT bleeding risk score[58]

A simple five-item bedside score to assess bleeding risk in AF to support clinical decision-making. The five items and their corresponding scores are as follows:

|O:|older age (≥75 years) = 1 point|
|---|---|
|R:|reduced haemoglobin/haematocrit/anaemia = 2 points|
|B:|bleeding history = 2 points|
|I:|insufficient kidney function = 1 point|
|T:|treatment with antiplatelets = 1 point|

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Diagnosis

A score 0-2 represents low risk, a score of 3 represents medium risk, and a score 4-7 represents high risk. Using data from the ORBIT-AF (Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation) study cohort, the ORBIT bleeding score was shown to be better than the HAS-BLED and ATRIA scores at identifying bleeding risk in patients with AF.[58]

# TREATMENT

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

# Treatment Step-by-step treatment approach

The three elements in the management of chronic AF are:

- Ventricular rate control
- Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm
- Prevention of thromboembolic events.

The goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and thromboembolic events. Treatment involves correction of the abnormal rate/rhythm, along with anticoagulation. Catheter and surgical ablation can be considered in patients with AF who continue to be highly symptomatic despite a trial of one or more anti-arrhythmic drugs. In some patients, especially young individuals with very symptomatic AF, ablation may be preferred over years of drug therapy. In a trial involving patients with AF and heart failure, catheter ablation was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalisation for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy.

Factors in the patient's presentation and diagnostic assessment that guide appropriate treatment include the following:

- Whether the patient is haemodynamically stable or unstable
- If haemodynamically stable, whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic
- The presence of associated heart failure
- The presence of a thrombus on transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)
- If a thrombus is absent on TOE, whether the patient has a high or low thromboembolic risk.

Need for hospital admission

Admission to hospital is indicated for the following patient groups:

- Patients with underlying heart disease who have haemodynamic consequences or symptoms of angina, heart failure, or syncope or who are at risk for a complication resulting from therapy of the arrhythmia
- Older patients
- Patients with associated or precipitant medical conditions that require further treatment, such as heart failure, pulmonary problems (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary embolism), hypertension, or hyperthyroidism.

Haemodynamically unstable AF

Patients with chronic AF who are stable may present acutely with haemodynamic instability. This may occur due to change in clinical situation (e.g., exacerbation of heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, hypoxia, metabolic abnormalities, etc). AF with a rapid ventricular rate causing ongoing chest pain, hypotension, shortness of breath, dizziness, or syncope requires immediate direct current (DC) cardioversion. This is performed under adequate short-acting general anaesthesia and involves delivery of an electrical shock synchronised with the intrinsic activity of the heart by sensing the R wave of the ECG (i.e., synchronised). The energy output for successful termination of acute AF varies from 200 J to a maximum of 400 J depending on body size and the presence of other comorbid conditions. Lower energy of 100 J may be used as the starting level when biphasic energy is used.

Haemodynamically stable AF: rate-control versus rhythm-control strategy

A clinical decision on initial management needs to be made as to whether to follow a primarily rate-control or rhythm-control strategy. A rate-control strategy aims to control the ventricular rate, but with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm. A rhythm-control strategy attempts to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. The treatment strategy depends on the severity and duration of the symptoms, and is individualised for each patient.[1] [2] [61]

While evidence from multiple studies indicates no difference in clinical outcomes with rate or rhythm-control strategies,[62] meta-analysis suggests lower rehospitalisation rates with pharmacological rate control for all ages, and support for rhythm control in younger patients.[63] [64]

Chronic atrial fibrillation Treatment

- A rate-control strategy might be more appropriate for older patients (>70 years), who are more prone to drug interactions and proarrhypmic effects of anti-arrhypmic drugs, such as exacerbation of underlying sinus node dysfunction. For younger patients wip preserved cardiac functions in whom AF can result in symptoms, it is appropriate to restore and maintain sinus rhypm by means of anti-arrhypmic drugs and left atrial ablation procedure involving pulmonary vein isolation and substrate modification, following cardioversion.
- Beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, and digoxin may be used in conjunction wip drugs typically used for heart failure, such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors. It should be remembered pat a rapid rate itself could contribute to heart failure symptoms, and continuing or increasing beta-blockers may be appropriate raper pan contraindicated in pese patients as long as oper medications such as diuretics are adjusted accordingly.

Rhythm control

- A rhypm-control strategy using anti-arrhypmic drugs, wip or wipout left atrial ablation, is followed for patients wip disabling symptoms wip eiper paroxysmal or persistent AF.
- Capeter ablation using radiofrequency or cryoablation for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) wip or wipout additional atrial substrate modification ablation strategies (e.g., ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms [CFAE], focal source, or rotors) should be considered for patients who are symptomatic from AF, who have failed previous attempts at direct current (DC) cardioversion, and in whom a trial of anti-arrhypmic agents has failed to restore and maintain sinus rhypm. Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation have been shown to provide equivalent outcomes.
- Currently, capeter ablation is only recommended as first-line perapy for patients wip paroxysmal AF.
- Specific treatment type depends on several factors.
- No or minimal heart disease or hypertension wip no left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH): dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol, followed by amiodarone, dofetilide, or capeter ablation. Alpough (like sotalol, propafenone, and flecainide) dronedarone is less effective pan amiodarone for pe maintenance of sinus rhypm, it has fewer adverse effects. Dronedarone is indicated to reduce pe risk of hospitalisation in patients wip paroxysmal or persistent AF and associated cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., age >70 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior cerebrovascular accident, left atrial diameter ≥50 mm, or left ventricular ejection fraction <40%), who are in sinus rhypm, or who will be cardioverted. It is contraindicated in patients wip AF who cannot, or will not, be converted into normal sinus rhypm (i.e., permanent AF) as a safety review showed pat dronedarone doubles pe risk of serious cardiovascular events including stroke, heart failure, and deap in patients wip permanent AF.
- Hypertension wip substantial LVH: amiodarone, followed by capeter ablation.
- Coronary artery disease (CAD): dofetilide, dronedarone, or sotalol, followed by amiodarone or capeter ablation.
- Heart failure: amiodarone, dofetilide, or capeter ablation. The adverse effects of anti-arrhypmic agents increase in pe presence of heart failure. To pat end, pe use of dronedarone is also contraindicated in patients wip New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure and NYHA class II-III heart failure wip recent decompensation requiring specialist care.

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

Treatment

- Adverse effects associated with use of anti-arrhythmics include bradycardia or worsening of underlying sinus node dysfunction, or atrioventricular (AV) block. There is a risk of other arrhythmias developing with the use of these anti-arrhythmics for AF.
- There are also certain specific side effects that are more associated with certain anti-arrhythmic agents. For example, with class Ic agents (i.e., propafenone or flecainide), conversion of AF to atrial flutter can occur with a faster ventricular response. This is due to slowing of the atrial cycle length allowing faster AV nodal conduction. Indeed, patients can present with a wide complex tachycardia simulating ventricular tachycardia due to rate-dependent conduction slowing in the ventricular myocardium or a bundle-branch block pattern. Therefore, patients eligible for the use of class Ic anti-arrhythmics should always be taking an AV nodal blocking drug (e.g., beta-blocker, diltiazem, or verapamil) before initiating treatment.
- Class Ic agents (flecainide, propafenone) have a higher mortality in patients with CAD and are contraindicated in patients with CAD and cardiac dysfunction. Patients eligible for these anti-arrhythmic agents should always be taking an AV nodal blocking drug (e.g., beta-blocker, diltiazem, or verapamil) before initiating treatment.
- Dofetilide and sotalol may cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. These agents should be initiated in hospital cautiously under close telemetry monitoring, and dosing should be modified based on creatinine clearance.
- It is important to monitor liver enzymes when patients are treated with dronedarone and amiodarone. For the latter, patients should also have at least 6-monthly assessment of thyroid function and annual assessment of pulmonary function tests, including lung oxygen diffusion capacity (DLCO).
- Compared with a rate-control strategy, restoring the sinus rhythm reduces the possibility of embolic stroke due to clot formation in the left atrium. Long-term anticoagulation for stroke prevention may not be necessary in the rhythm-control group. However, one should be cautious in assuming that rhythm control is always effective. Recurrences are common, and asymptomatic AF is frequent when patients have been followed after AF ablations clinically and with cardiac implantable electronic devices. Even though there may be electrical sinus rhythm, mechanical function may not be adequate, and stasis and the other causes of thrombus formation may still exist. The decision to continue with anticoagulation and type used should take into account the risks of the therapy and the risk for stroke.
- Attention to rate control, even when in sinus rhythm, is also necessary.

Coronary artery disease
Thyrotoxicosis.

Moderate risk factors:

- Age 75 years or older
- Hypertension
- Heart failure
- Left ventricular ejection fraction 35% or less
- Diabetes mellitus.

High risk factors:

- Previous stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or embolism
- Mitral stenosis
- Prosthetic heart valve.

Use of any anticoagulation strategy needs to be balanced with the risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial bleeding.[78] In high-risk individuals with AF, commonly used oral anticoagulation agents for stroke prevention are warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban. All patients should preferably be started on a DOAC, unless they are not eligible (e.g., presence of moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves) or DOACs are not available.[61]

Historically, warfarin is often underused in older patients due to the genuine or perceived fear of hemorrhage.[79] [80]

Unlike warfarin, DOACs are non-vitamin K-dependent, and have been approved in the US and in Europe for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban as possible treatments for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with AF.[81] [82] [83] [84]

Dabigatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was favorably compared with warfarin in patients with AF at increased risk of stroke in the RE-LY trial that included 18,113 patients and had a median follow-up of 2 years.[85] Compared with warfarin, dabigatran at a lower dose showed non-inferiority and, at higher doses, it showed superiority regarding rates of stroke and systemic embolism (warfarin 1.69% per year, lower dose dabigatran 1.53%/year, and higher dose dabigatran 1.11%/year for a primary endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism). Adverse bleeding event rates were lower with a lower dose and similar with a higher dose of dabigatran compared with warfarin. Although there were significantly higher rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding with a higher dose of dabigatran, intracranial bleeding was significantly lower with both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin.[85]

Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban were compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF in the ROCKET AF (14,264 patients and a median follow-up of 1.9 years),[86] [87] ARISTOTLE (18,201 patients and a median follow-up of 1.8 years),[88] and ENGAGE AF (21,105 patients and a median follow-up of 2.8 years)[89] trials, respectively. The primary endpoint of stroke and/or systemic embolism endpoints were 1.7%/year with rivaroxaban compared with 2.2%/year with warfarin in the ROCKET AF, 1.27%/year with apixaban compared with 1.6%/year with warfarin in ARISTOTLE, and 1.61%/year with a lower dose and 1.18%/year a higher dose edoxaban compared with 1.50%/year with warfarin in ENGAGE AF trials, respectively.[86] [87] [88] [89] These trials, together with results of meta-analysis, show...

Treatment
Analyses, have shown pat DOACs are non-inferior to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients wip non-valvular AF, and may be associated wip a reduced risk of fatal bleeding.[90] [91]
It is, perefore, reasonable to use a DOAC as a first-line agent or subsequent replacement for warfarin in patients wip AF. DOACs are generally safe in older patients; however, dabigatran may be associated wip an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared wip warfarin.[92]
DOACs should be used wip caution in patients wip renal impairment. Some DOACs may be used in patients wip renal impairment; however, a dose adjustment may be required. Opers are not recommended, depending on pe degree of renal impairment and pe indication for use. Consult pe prescribing information for specific guidance on use in patients wip renal impairment. In patients wip non-valvular AF and mild or moderate renal impairment, pe use of DOACs has been found to be associated wip a reduced risk of stroke or systemic embolism and a reduced risk of major bleeding compared wip warfarin, which suggests a favourable risk profile of pese agents in patients wip mild to moderate renal disease.[93] DOACs should not be used in patients wip mechanical prospetic valves or moderate to severe mitral stenosis, nor should pey be used in combination wip heparin (including low molecular weight heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.
The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation wip warfarin is highly dependent on pe quality of anticoagulation control as reflected by pe average time in perapeutic range (TTR) of INR 2 to 3. The SAMe-TT(2)R(2) scoring system (based on sex, age, medical history, treatment interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool pat may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients who are less likely to maintain TTR &gt;70% and who should, perefore, be managed wip DOACs instead of warfarin.[94] [95]
Aspirin may be used for some patients (e.g., pose wip no risk factors for promboembolism). The decision to administer aspirin for long-term perapy should be individualised and discussed wip pe patient as no major consensus exists for pose wip a CHADS2 score of 1, or a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 (in males) or 1 (in females).[2] [13]
NICE advises pat adults wip atrial fibrillation should not be prescribed aspirin as monoperapy for stroke prevention. Adults wip atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation should discuss pe options wip peir healpcare professional at least once per year.[96]

Cardioversion

Cardioversion is indicated in patients in AF with disabling symptoms. In patients with haemodynamically stable persistent AF with preserved left ventricular function and no evidence of hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, pharmacological cardioversion may be attempted with administration of ibutilide intravenously under close telemetry monitoring. Ibutilide prolongs repolarisation of the atrial tissue by enhancing the slow inward depolarising sodium current in the plateau phase of repolarisation. For cardioversion of acute AF and atrial flutter to sinus rhythm, ibutilide is very efficacious; the conversion rate of persistent and chronic AF lasting for more than 30 days is approximately 48%.[97] Because the half-life of ibutilide is 3 to 6 hours, prolonged observation period is recommended in patients who have received ibutilide.[98] [99] For patients requiring more immediate conversion (e.g., patients with congestive heart failure), intravenous anticoagulation is initiated, followed by TOE to rule out left atrial appendage clot.[100]

If clots are absent, pharmacological or DC cardioversion can be done, wip or wipout anticoagulation. If clots are present, a rate-control strategy is used as immediate cardioversion is ruled out.
Patients wip haemodynamically unstable AF and a rapid ventricular rate causing ongoing chest pain, hypotension, shortness of breap, dizziness, or syncope require immediate DC cardioversion. This is

|performed under adequate short-acting general anaesthesia and involves delivery of an electrical shock synchronised with the intrinsic activity of the heart by sensing the R wave of the ECG (i.e., synchronised). The energy output for successful termination of acute AF varies from 200 J to a maximum of 400 J depending on body size and the presence of other comorbid conditions. Lower energy of 100 J may be used as the starting level when biphasic energy is used. If the duration of AF is under 48 hours, DC cardioversion is thought to be safe, with a low risk of a thromboembolic event with anticoagulation afterwards. However, AF that is asymptomatic before the immediate event is common, making a determination of the duration uncertain. Patients can be pre-treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs or drugs known to lower cardioversion thresholds, such as ibutilide or sotalol.[98] [99]| |
|Catheter/surgical ablation| |
|Catheter ablation can be done using two methods: radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation; both result in similar outcomes.[71] [72] [101] Radiofrequency or cryoablation for PVI with or without additional atrial substrate modification ablation strategies (e.g., ablation of CFAE, focal source, or rotors) should be considered for patients who are symptomatic from AF, who have failed previous attempts at DC cardioversion, and in whom trial of anti-arrhythmic agents has failed to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. Catheter ablation is only recommended as first-line therapy for patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF.[101] Catheter ablation has been shown to be cost-effective.[102] [103] Patients with persistent AF who are in AF at the time of ablation should have a TOE performed to screen for thrombus. The presence of a left atrial thrombus is a contraindication to catheter ablation of AF. In such patients, surgical approach that includes resection of the left atrial appendage in addition to pulmonary vein isolation and the left atrial substrate modification surgically would be more appropriate.| |
|Following ablation therapy, anticoagulation is continued for at least 3 to 6 months and then reassessed. At this point, the patient's stroke risk score influences the decision concerning the need to continue anticoagulation or not. Rate-lowering medicines and anti-arrhythmics may also be continued, but this will depend on various patient factors, and the decision is individualised. If patients fail catheter ablation, a repeat procedure often results in a better success rate. Some patients with persistent (as opposed to paroxysmal) AF might require 2 procedures to achieve better results. Surgical ablation is another option but does not necessarily have to follow a failed percutaneous catheter ablation.| |
|Surgical ablation (open surgery, rather than using catheter techniques) is most often reserved for those who are having surgery for other reasons, such as bypass or valve surgery (e.g., mitral-valve surgery). AF is present in 30% to 50% of patients undergoing mitral-valve surgery, and is associated with an increased risk for stroke. One study found that surgical ablation carried out during mitral-valve surgery prevented AF at 1 year among patients with persistent AF.[104] Surgical ablation may also be used in patients with left atrial thrombus, or it may be chosen by certain patients who do not prefer the catheter approach, in which case a minimally invasive surgical approach is often used.[101] [105] The Cox maze procedure is the conventional surgical approach. Multiple, precisely placed incisions are made in both atria, with the aim of isolating and terminating the abnormal electrical impulses' routes. The Cox maze IV procedure uses a modified approach. Alternative methods of creating lesions in the atria by ablation rather than incision have also been developed (e.g., radiofrequency, microwave, cryotherapy, and ultrasound).| |
|In terms of justification of ablation therapy as a first-line therapy compared with anti-arrhythmic drugs, randomised control trials such as the RAAFT (Radiofrequency Ablation versus antiarrhythmic drug for Atrial Fibrillation Treatment) II trial and the MANTRA-PAF (Medical ANtiarrhythmic Treatment or Radiofrequency Ablation in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation) trial have shown better outcomes for freedom from any AF or symptomatic AF, and improvement in quality of life with ablation.[108] [109] On the basis| |

# Chronic atrial fibrillation Treatment

Based on these data, radiofrequency catheter ablation may be considered as first-line therapy in select patients prior to a trial of anti-arrhythmic drug therapy when a rhythm control strategy is desired.

One larger multi-centre randomised trial, the Catheter Ablation versus anti-arrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial, found that, compared with medical therapy, catheter ablation led to improvements in quality of life, but did not significantly reduce a composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Another randomised trial showed that the primary end point, composite of all-cause mortality and unplanned hospitalisation for worsening heart failure, significantly improved with catheter ablation. In the CASTLE-AF trial, in patients with heart failure, catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalisation for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.87; P=0.007). These findings indicate that catheter ablation should be considered sooner in patients with AF and LV dysfunction.

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Treatment

Acute compared with warfarin in large, randomised clinical trials for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. It is, therefore, reasonable to use a DOAC as a first-line agent or subsequent replacement for warfarin in patients with AF. DOACs are generally safe in older patients; however, dabigatran may be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin.

DOACs should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Some DOACs may be used in patients with renal impairment; however, a dose adjustment may be required. Others are not recommended, depending on the degree of renal impairment and the indication for use. Consult the prescribing information for specific guidance on use in patients with renal impairment.

In patients with non-valvular AF and mild or moderate renal impairment, the use of DOACs has been found to be associated with a reduced risk of stroke or systemic embolism and a reduced risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, which suggests a favourable risk profile of these agents in patients with mild to moderate renal disease. DOACs should not be used in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or moderate to severe mitral stenosis, nor should they be used in combination with heparin (including low molecular weight heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.

The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation with warfarin is highly dependent on the quality of anticoagulation control as reflected by the average time in therapeutic range (TTR) of INR 2 to 3. The SAMe-TT(2)R(2) scoring system (based on sex, age, medical history, treatment interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool that may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients who are less likely to maintain TTR &gt;70% and who should, therefore, be managed with DOACs instead of warfarin.

There is no consensus among guidelines concerning aspirin versus no aspirin for low-risk patients.

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Treatment
Acute pharmacological rate control for all ages, and support for rhypm control in younger patients.[63] [64]

The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend heart rate control (resting heart rate <80 bpm) for symptomatic management of atrial fibrillation in patients who are haemodynamically stable.[2] However, attempt at aggressive rate control with pharmacological agents may result in significant depression of the left ventricular systolic function. In some patients who have slow resting heart rates, drug therapy could be hazardous. Alternatively, a lenient rate-control strategy (resting heart rate <110 bpm) may be reasonable as long as patients remain asymptomatic and left ventricular systolic function is preserved. For these reasons, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines support lenient rate control (resting heart rate of <100 bpm) for target rate control therapy.[1] Hence, although generally suggested goals are 60-80 bpm at rest and <115 bpm with exercise,[1] [2] [65] it is necessary to take an individualised approach.

All patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF and no heart disease and who require rate control are treated initially with a beta-blocker, diltiazem, verapamil, or digoxin. Beta-blockers are the preferred choice, but alternative agents should be used if they are contraindicated or if an increased risk of side effects is present (e.g., asthma).

A rate-control strategy might be more appropriate for older patients (>70 years) who are more prone to drug interactions and pro-arrhythmic effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., exacerbation of underlying sinus node dysfunction).[67] [68] [69] [70]

# TREATMENT

Chronic atrial fibrillation

# Acute Treatment

- Indicated in patients with disabling symptoms.
- In haemodynamically stable patients with preserved left ventricular function and no evidence of hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, pharmacological cardioversion may be attempted with intravenous ibutilide administration under close telemetry monitoring. It is very efficacious for cardioversion of acute AF, with a conversion rate of approximately 48% for persistent and chronic AF lasting longer than 30 days. As the half-life of ibutilide is 3-6 hours, prolonged observation is recommended following its administration.
- For patients requiring more immediate conversion (e.g., patients with congestive heart failure), intravenous anticoagulation is initiated, followed by a transoesophageal echocardiogram to rule out a left atrial appendage clot. If clots are absent, pharmacological or DC cardioversion can be done, with or without anticoagulation. If clots are present, a rate-control strategy is used as immediate cardioversion is ruled out.
- Severe haemodynamic compromise may warrant immediate electrical cardioversion with sedation. Patients can be pre-treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs or drugs known to lower cardioversion thresholds, such as ibutilide or sotalol.
- Anticoagulation and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm should be continued as needed.
- If cardioversion, anti-arrhythmics, and catheter ablation (rhythm-control strategy) fail to maintain sinus rhythm, the rate-control strategy alone should be followed.

The risks and benefits of attempting rhythm control should be assessed on a patient by patient basis.

While evidence from multiple studies indicates no difference in clinical outcomes with rate or rhythm-control strategies, meta-analysis suggests lower rehospitalisation rates with pharmacological rate control for all ages, and support for rhythm control in younger patients.

For younger patients with preserved cardiac function, in whom AF can result in symptoms, it is appropriate to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (rhythm-control strategy) by means of anti-arrhythmic drugs and a left atrial ablation procedure involving pulmonary vein isolation and substrate modification, following cardioversion.

Paroxysmal or persistent AF with no or minimal heart disease, or hypertension without left ventricular hypertrophy should be treated with dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol, followed by amiodarone, dofetilide, or catheter ablation.

Adverse effects of anti-arrhythmics include bradycardia, worsening of underlying sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular (AV) block, or the development of another arrhythmia. Other specific side effects are associated with certain anti-arrhythmic agents, and certain patients may have factors that contraindicate the safe use of particular anti-arrhythmics. For example, sotalol may cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; therefore, it should be initiated within the hospital cautiously under close telemetry monitoring, and dosing should be modified based on creatinine clearance.

Patients eligible for class 1c anti-arrhythmics (i.e., propafenone or flecainide), should always be taking an AV nodal blocking drug (e.g., beta-blocker, diltiazem, or verapamil) before initiating treatment.

Dronedarone is a multiclass anti-arrhythmic agent. Although (like sotalol, propafenone, and flecainide) dronedarone is less effective than amiodarone for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, it has fewer adverse effects. Dronedarone is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalisation in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF and associated cardiovascular.

Acute specific side effects are associated with certain anti-arrhythmic agents, and certain patients may have factors that contraindicate the safe use of particular anti-arrhythmics. For example, dofetilide may cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; therefore, it should be initiated within the hospital cautiously under close telemetry monitoring, and dosing should be modified based on creatinine clearance.

- Catheter ablation (e.g., using radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation) for pulmonary vein isolation with or without additional atrial substrate modification ablation strategies, such as ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms, focal source, or rotors, should be considered for patients who are symptomatic from AF, who have failed previous attempts at direct current cardioversion, and in whom trial of anti-arrhythmic agents has failed to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation have been shown to provide equivalent outcomes.
- Catheter and surgical ablation have excellent long-term results. Currently, catheter ablation is only recommended as first-line therapy for patients with paroxysmal AF. Patients with persistent AF who are in AF at the time of ablation should have a transoesophageal echocardiogram performed to screen for thrombus. The presence of a left atrial thrombus is a contraindication to catheter ablation of AF. In such patients, a surgical approach that includes resection of the left atrial appendage in addition to pulmonary vein isolation and the left atrial substrate modification surgically would be more appropriate.
- Following ablation, anticoagulation is continued for at least 3 to 6 months. Rate-lowering medications and anti-arrhythmics may also be continued.
- Surgical ablation (open surgery, rather than using catheter techniques) is most often reserved for those who are having surgery for other reasons, such as bypass or valve surgery. It may also be used in patients with left atrial thrombus, or may be chosen by certain patients who do not prefer the catheter approach, in which case a minimally invasive surgical approach is often used.
- If cardioversion, anti-arrhythmics, and catheter ablation (rhythm-control strategy) fail to maintain sinus rhythm, the rate-control strategy alone should be followed.

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

# Treatment

Acute unless they are not eligible (e.g., presence of moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves) or DOACs are not available. Historically, warfarin is often underused in older patients due to the genuine or perceived fear of hemorrhage.

Unlike warfarin, DOACs are non-vitamin K-dependent, and have been approved in the US for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. While dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban inhibit factor Xa directly. All DOACs have consistently shown safety and efficacy compared with warfarin in large, randomized clinical trials for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. It is, therefore, reasonable to use a DOAC as a first-line agent or subsequent replacement for warfarin in patients with AF. DOACs are generally safe in older patients; however, dabigatran may be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin.

DOACs should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Some DOACs may be used in patients with renal impairment; however, a dose adjustment may be required. Others are not recommended, depending on the degree of renal impairment and the indication for use. Consult the prescribing information for specific guidance on use in patients with renal impairment.

In patients with non-valvular AF and mild or moderate renal impairment, the use of DOACs has been found to be associated with a reduced risk of stroke or systemic embolism and a reduced risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, which suggests a favorable risk profile of these agents in patients with mild to moderate renal disease. DOACs should not be used in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or moderate to severe mitral stenosis, nor should they be used in combination with heparin (including low molecular weight heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.

The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation with warfarin is highly dependent on the quality of anticoagulation control as reflected by the average time in therapeutic range (TTR) of INR 2 to 3. The SAMe-TT(2)R(2) scoring system (based on sex, age, medical history, treatment interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool that may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients who are less likely to maintain TTR >70%.

|The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend heart rate control (resting heart rate <80 bpm) for symptomatic management of atrial fibrillation in patients who are haemodynamically stable.[2] However, attempt at aggressive rate control with pharmacological agents may result in significant depression of the left ventricular systolic function. In some patients who have slow resting heart rates, drug therapy could be hazardous. Alternatively, a lenient rate-control strategy (resting heart rate <110 bpm) may be reasonable as long as patients remain asymptomatic and left ventricular systolic function is preserved. For these reasons, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines support lenient rate control (resting heart rate of <100 bpm) for target rate control therapy.[1] Hence, although generally suggested goals are 60-80 bpm at rest and <115 bpm with exercise,[1] [2] [65] it is necessary to take an individualised approach.| |
| | |
| | |
|All patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF and no heart disease and who require rate control are treated initially with a beta-blocker, diltiazem, verapamil, or digoxin. Beta-blockers are the preferred choice, but alternative agents should be used if they are contraindicated or if an increased risk of side effects is present (e.g., asthma).| |
| | |

|A rate-control strategy might be more appropriate for older patients (>70 years) who are more prone to drug interactions and pro-arrhythmic effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., exacerbation of underlying sinus node dysfunction).[67] [68] [69] [70]| |

# Chronic atrial fibrillation Treatment

Acute

- Indicated in patients with disabling symptoms.
- In haemodynamically stable patients with preserved left ventricular function and no evidence of hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, pharmacological cardioversion may be attempted with intravenous ibutilide administration under close telemetry monitoring. It is very efficacious for cardioversion of acute AF, with a conversion rate of approximately 48% for persistent and chronic AF lasting longer than 30 days. As the half-life of ibutilide is 3 to 6 hours, prolonged observation is recommended following its administration.
- For patients requiring more immediate conversion (e.g., patients with congestive heart failure), intravenous anticoagulation is initiated, followed by a transoesophageal echocardiogram to rule out a left atrial appendage clot. If clots are absent, pharmacological or direct current cardioversion can be done, with or without anticoagulation. If clots are present, a rate-control strategy is used as immediate cardioversion is ruled out.
- Severe haemodynamic compromise may warrant immediate direct current cardioversion with sedation. Patients can be pre-treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs or drugs known to lower cardioversion thresholds, such as ibutilide or sotalol.
- Anticoagulation and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm should be continued as needed.
- If cardioversion, anti-arrhythmics, and catheter ablation (rhythm-control strategy) fail to maintain sinus rhythm, the rate-control strategy alone should be followed.

# TREATMENT

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Treatment

Acute

- The risks and benefits of attempting rhythm control should be assessed on a patient by patient basis.
- While evidence from multiple studies indicates no difference in clinical outcomes with rate or rhythm-control strategies, meta-analysis suggests lower rehospitalisation rates with pharmacological rate control for all ages, and support for rhythm control in younger patients.
- For younger patients with preserved cardiac function, in whom AF can result in symptoms, it is appropriate to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (rhythm-control strategy) by means of anti-arrhythmic drugs and a left atrial ablation procedure involving pulmonary vein isolation and substrate modification, following cardioversion.
- Adverse effects of anti-arrhythmics include bradycardia, worsening of underlying sinus node dysfunction, AV block, or the development of another arrhythmia. Other specific side effects are associated with certain anti-arrhythmic agents, and certain patients may have factors that contraindicate the safe use of particular anti-arrhythmics. For example, class Ic agents (flecainide, propafenone) have a higher mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, and are contraindicated in these patients. Dofetilide and sotalol may cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; therefore, these agents should be initiated within the hospital cautiously under close telemetry monitoring, and dosing should be modified based on creatinine clearance.
- Dronedarone is a multiclass anti-arrhythmic agent. Although (like sotalol) dronedarone is less effective than amiodarone for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, it has fewer adverse effects. Dronedarone is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalisation in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF and associated cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., age >70 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior cerebrovascular accident, left atrial diameter ≥50 mm, or left ventricular ejection fraction <40%), who are in sinus rhythm, or who will be cardioverted. Contraindicated in patients with permanent AF, NYHA class IV heart failure, and NYHA class II-III heart failure with recent decompensation requiring specialist care. Adverse effects include an elevated risk of worsening or new-onset heart failure and liver toxicity. Patients should undergo regular liver function testing and be advised to be vigilant for the symptoms of heart failure and liver toxicity.

Anticoagulation use is based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score (2 points assigned for history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 2 points for age ≥75 years; 1 point each for age 65-74 years, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, recent cardiac failure, vascular disease [myocardial infarction, complex aortic plaque, peripheral arterial disease [prior revascularisation, amputation, angiographic evidence)], female sex), which estimates the risk of thromboembolic stroke.

In high-risk individuals with AF, commonly used oral anticoagulation agents for stroke prevention are warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban. All patients should preferably be started on a DOAC, unless they are not eligible (e.g., presence of moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves) or DOACs are not available. Historically, warfarin is often underused in older patients due to the genuine or perceived fear of hemorrhage.

Unlike warfarin, DOACs are non-vitamin K-dependent, and have been approved in the US for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. While dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban inhibit factor Xa directly. All DOACs have consistently shown safety and efficacy compared with warfarin in large, randomized clinical trials for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. It is, therefore, reasonable to use a DOAC as a first-line agent or subsequent replacement for warfarin in patients with AF. DOACs are generally safe in older patients; however, dabigatran may be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin.

DOACs should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Some DOACs may be used in patients with renal impairment;

Opers are not recommended, depending on pe degree of renal impairment and pe indication for use. Consult pe prescribing information for specific guidance on use in patients wip renal impairment.
In patients wip non-valvular AF and mild or moderate renal impairment, pe use of DOACs has been found to be associated wip a reduced risk of stroke or systemic embolism and a reduced risk of major bleeding compared wip warfarin, which suggests a favorable risk profile of pese agents in patients wip mild to moderate renal disease.[93] DOACs should not be used in patients wip mechanical prospetic valves or moderate to severe mitral stenosis, nor should pey be used in combination wip heparin (including low molecular weight heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.

# TREATMENT

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Treatment

Ongoing
The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation wip warfarin is highly dependent on pe quality of anticoagulation control as reflected by pe average time in perapeutic range (TTR) of INR 2 to 3. The SAMe-TT(2)R(2) scoring system (based on sex, age, medical history, treatment interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool pat may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients who are less likely to maintain TTR >70% and who should, perefore, be managed wip DOACs instead of warfarin.[94] [95]
There is no consensus among guidelines concerning aspirin versus no aspirin for low-risk patients.[1] [2] [13] The American Heart Association guidelines include aspirin as an option, while European Society of Cardiology and National Institute for Healp and Care Excellence guidelines do not recommend aspirin. Generally, in patients wip no risk factors, treatment wip aspirin is reasonable.
Use of any anticoagulation strategy should be balanced wip pe risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial bleeding.[78] Scoring systems have been developed to help to quantify pe risk of bleeding wip anticoagulants.[56] [57]

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Treatment

Ongoing
diltiazem: 60-120 mg orally (immediate-release) pree times daily
OR
verapamil: 40-120 mg orally (immediate-release) pree times daily
OR
digoxin: 125-500 micrograms orally once daily

In the subgroup of patients with permanent AF it is accepted, both by patients and physicians, that attempts at restoration of sinus rhythm would either be unsuccessful or detrimental. Therefore, instead of rhythm control, a strategy of rate control is followed.

Patients with permanent AF requiring rate control are treated initially with a beta-blocker, diltiazem, verapamil, or digoxin. Beta-blockers are the preferred choice, but alternative agents should be used if they are contraindicated or if an increased risk of side effects is present (e.g., asthma).

# TREATMENT

Chronic atrial fibrillation

Treatment Emerging

New anti-arrhythmics

Vernakalant is a new atrial-selective anti-arrhythmic agent, which has been shown to be efficacious and safe in converting recent-onset AF to sinus rhythm.[113]

Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure devices

Left atrial appendage closure devices such as the WATCHMAN and the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug device may be implanted percutaneously. Pertaining to the WATCHMAN device, it is deployed percutaneously via transeptal puncture and has a polyethylene membrane that covers a self-expanding nitinol cage with barbs to anchor the device in the LAA. In the PROTECT AF trial, the primary efficacy event rate (a composite endpoint of stroke, cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism) of the WATCHMAN device was considered non-inferior to that of warfarin.[114] There was a higher rate of adverse safety events in the intervention group than in the control group, due mainly to peri-procedural complications. The Amplatzer Cardiac Plug consists of a small proximal disc, a central polyester patch, and a larger distal disc with hooks to anchor the device in the LAA. It does not require anticoagulation and a European-based trial found a 96% success rate for deployment/implantation but with a 7% incidence of serious complications.[115] Another non-pharmacological approach to isolate and occlude LAA is to tie off the LAA using the LARIAT device, which is an epicardial snare. Currently, WATCHMAN is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved device, but more experience and outcome data are required, as with other closure devices, for general usage.[116]

Atrial pacing therapy

Despite some early studies that indicated that the use of preventative pacing can reduce atrial arrhythmia burden and symptomatic AF in selected patients,[1] it is general consensus that pacing therapy does not offer substantial help for prevention and rhythm control therapy for chronic AF. The Atrial Dynamic Overdrive Pacing Trial (ADOPT) demonstrated that overdrive atrial pacing with the AF Suppression Algorithm decreased symptomatic AF burden significantly in patients with sick sinus syndrome and AF.[117] The decrease in relative AF burden was substantial (25%), although the absolute difference was small (2.50% control versus 1.87% treatment). Overdrive single-site pacing in the right atrium, achieved by programming different base rate and rest rate pacing in the Atrial Overdrive Pacing study, did not reduce AF as assessed by mode switch episodes.[118] In Dual-Site Atrial Pacing to Prevent AF (DAPPAF) trial, the dual-site right atrial prolonged and the high right atrial pacing trended to prolong time-to-recurrent-AF compared with standard pacing, but only in those patients who were on anti-arrhythmics.[119] More studies are needed to investigate this preventative treatment further.

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

# Recommendations

Monitoring

For a patient with persistent AF that is felt to be secondary to a reversible cause and once that cause has been removed, long-term follow-up may not be necessary after the initial treatment and evaluation of the AF. For a patient requiring continued therapy due to the assessment of risk of recurrence, follow-up should include the following general categories:

- Adequate treatment of the associated medical/cardiac diagnosis
- Periodic assessments of efficacy of therapy
- Periodic evaluation for the adverse effects or complications of therapy
- Maintenance and monitoring of adequate anticoagulation
- Re-evaluation of the current therapy if the underlying cardiovascular problem changes or progresses or the AF becomes permanent.

As some patients with AF have asymptomatic recurrences irrespective of the therapy (anti-arrhythmic drug or ablation), anticoagulation should be considered long term. Evaluation of AF burden with a Holter monitor, event monitor, pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator, or insertable loop monitor can be considered if the patient is symptomatic. This is largely to ensure that ventricular rates are controlled if persistent AF progresses to permanent AF or the amount and duration of AF episodes change. Clearly any change in the clinical status of a patient with a history of AF should prompt the physician to look for a recurrence as the cause of the clinical change.

Patient instructions

Patients should avoid any trigger factors (e.g., caffeine, alcohol) and adjust their lifestyle to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors where possible. Gait training in patients taking warfarin will reduce complications of falls. Online patient information from recommended sources may be helpful. [NHS Choices: atrial fibrillation] [UpBeat: atrial fibrillation] [AHA: atrial fibrillation (AF or AFib)]

# Chronic atrial fibrillation Follow Up

|Complications|Timeframe|Likelihood|
|---|---|---|
|Exacerbation of reactive airway disease associated with beta-blocker therapy|Short term|Medium|
|Complications of surgical ablation|Short term|Low|
|Amiodarone-associated pulmonary toxicity|Long term|Low|
|Death|Variable|High|
|Bradycardia|Variable|High|
|Stroke|Variable|Medium|

AF is an independent risk factor for death. The relative risk for death ranges from 1.3 to 2.6 and is increased in female patients. Both AFFIRM and RACE trials demonstrated similar survival rate between the rate control group and the rhythm control group. In the AFFIRM trial, mortality at 5 years was 21.3% versus 23.8%, respectively. The tendency towards higher mortality in the rhythm control group is explained by increased use of anti-arrhythmic drugs and under-representation of younger patients with normal hearts in these trials. In fact, a controlled trial suggests that restoring sinus rhythm with ablative therapy improves survival and quality of life compared with medical therapy of AF. In a 600-day follow-up, 6% (38) of ablated patients and 16% (83) in the medical group had died.

As shown in a substudy of the AFFIRM trial (a comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with AF), a recent history of smoking among patients with AF was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. The results did not show any association with all-cause hospitalisation.

Bradycardia can occur due to profound effects on the atrioventricular node while in AF or to the effects on the sinus node when in sinus rhythm, particularly in patients with underlying sinus node dysfunction. Can occur with anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., flecainide or amiodarone) as well. May require changing drug, or permanent pacing.

In patients with non-valvular AF, the annual adjusted stroke rate is 1.9% to 18.2% per year depending on patients' comorbidities and CHADS scores. Annual rate of stroke for patients taking aspirin is similar between patients with paroxysmal and with long-standing persistent AF (3.2% versus 3.3%).

# Chronic atrial fibrillation

|Complications|Timeframe|Likelihood|
|---|---|---|
|Preventing stroke, especially in older patients, is a vital health concern.[129] [130] [131] The challenge of prevention with either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents lies with balancing reduction of risk of major stroke with the increased risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial bleeding.[78]| | |
|A cohort study concluded that patients with resolved atrial fibrillation remain at higher risk of stroke or transient ischaemic attack than patients without atrial fibrillation and that the risk is increased even in those in whom recurrent atrial fibrillation is not documented.[132]| | |

# hypotension

variable
medium

Secondary to the vasodilatory effects of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, as well as atrioventricular (AV) nodal effects slowing the heart rate. If this occurs, lowering the dose can be considered. Other causes of hypotension should be sought. If the strategy was rate control only, AV nodal ablation can be considered for rate control if drugs cause too many adverse effects. Rhythm control can also be reconsidered in some patients.

# heart failure

variable
medium

May be due to the negative inotropic effects of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, as well as some anti-arrhythmic drugs. These drugs should be used cautiously in patients with poor left ventricular function and not at all in patients with overt clinical heart failure until the heart failure is treated and compensated. This can be challenging and there is a need to optimise the heart failure regimen.

In addition, a rapid rate itself could contribute to heart failure symptoms, and continuing or increasing beta-blockers may be appropriate rather than contraindicated as long as other medications such as diuretics are adjusted accordingly.

If heart rate control or rhythm control is the goal, amiodarone can be used with little depression of contractility.

# pro-arrhythmia associated with anti-arrhythmic drugs

variable
medium

May take many forms depending on the type and drug used. The most dangerous are ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes. Occurs with anti-arrhythmic drugs that prolong the QT or with drugs that prolong conduction such as propafenone in patients with underlying coronary disease. Physicians should know the pharmacology and drug interactions and use the recommendations outlined in the guidelines for the treatment of AF.

# amiodarone-associated thyroid dysfunction

variable
medium

An unusual complication of amiodarone due to it containing iodine. Common to see elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone and more common to see hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism unless the patient has a predilection to hyperthyroidism or a previous goitre. Can replace thyroid hormone orally for hypothyroidism but usual need to discontinue the drug if hyperthyroid and treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

# complications of catheter ablation

variable
low

Complications vary with the technique and experience, and some have decreased with modification of ablation strategies. They include cerebrovascular events (0% to 4%), pulmonary vein stenosis (1% to 3%).
---
# FOLLOW UP

|Complications|Timeframe|Likelihood|
|---|---|---|
|oesophageal injury and fistula (about 0.01%, but probably underestimated), pericardial effusion (usually uncomplicated) (25%), pericardial tamponade (1%), organised atrial tachyarrhythmias (2% to 20%), and other rare complications such as aortic root injury and phrenic nerve injury.[133] [134] Most of the complications are handled acutely. Pulmonary vein stenosis, although becoming less common with newer techniques, still remains a potential complication. Can present late with dyspnoea. Work-up should include computed tomography of pulmonary veins and ventilation perfusion scan. Treatment includes pulmonary vein stenting, but results are mixed. Best treatment is prevention with good technique.| | |

# Prognosis

The prognosis depends on several factors, such as the precipitating event, underlying cardiac status, risk of thromboembolism, and whether the nature of the AF is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent. Almost 25% of patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF progress to a more sustained form within 1.5 years, whereby heart rate and age are strong predictors for AF progression.[120] Short- and long-term prognosis for patients presenting with new onset of AF and its relation to heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI) is poor. One large Swedish cohort study involving patients hospitalised for MI has found a 30% higher risk of cardiovascular events (i.e., all-cause mortality, MI, and ischaemic stroke) among those presenting with AF (all types) compared with those in sinus rhythm.[121] Patients with MI who also present with AF need close clinical follow-up.

# Introduction

‘Whiplash-associated disorders’ (WAD) is the term given to the variety of symptoms often reported by people following acceleration/deceleration injury to the neck, most commonly via a road traffic crash. The cardinal symptom is neck pain but neck stiffness, dizziness, paraesthesia/anaesthesia in the upper quadrant, headache and arm pain are also commonly reported. The neck-related pain is associated with disability, decreased quality of life, and psychological distress. Due to WAD often being a compensable injury, it is a controversial condition, with some still denying it as a legitimate condition. This is despite the wealth of evidence demonstrating both physical and psychological manifestations that have implications for management. This narrative review will outline the burden of WAD, the clinical pathway following injury, and factors predictive of both good and poor recovery. The diagnosis and assessment of WAD will be discussed. This will be followed by an overview of the current evidence for management of the condition and future directions for research and clinical practice in order to improve health outcomes for this condition.

The burden of WAD

Whiplash injury following a road traffic crash is common, with recent figures suggesting more than 300 persons per 100,000 are seen in emergency departments every year in Europe and North America, and in Australia, whiplash injuries comprise ∼75% of all survivable road traffic crash injuries. Musculoskeletal conditions and injuries from road traffic crashes account for a large proportion of disease burden worldwide, with the burden associated with such conditions increasing. The economic costs of whiplash injuries in Queensland, Australia are substantial and exceeded $350 million from 2011 to 2012. In New South Wales in the period 1989–1998, there were 50,000 whiplash compulsory third-party claims costing ∼$1.5 billion. The total costs associated with whiplash injury exceed costs for both spinal cord and traumatic brain injury sustained in road traffic crashes. The situation is little different in other Western countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, whiplash personal injury claims exceeded £3 billion per year, while in the United States, costs reached US$230 billion per annum in 2000.

Consistent international data indicate that approximately 50% of people who sustain a whiplash injury will not recover but will continue to report ongoing pain and disability one year after the injury. Mental health outcomes are also poor, with the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in people with persistent WAD being 25% for post-traumatic stress disorder, 31% for Major Depressive Episode, and 20% for Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Individuals with mental health problems report higher levels of disability, pain, and reduced physical function, and conditions with comorbid physical injury and psychiatric disorder are associated with double the health care utilisation and considerably greater time off work compared to those with physical injury alone.

# Clinical course of WAD and prognostic factors for recovery and non-recovery

Cohort studies have demonstrated that recovery, if it occurs, takes place within the first 2–3 months following the injury with a plateau in recovery following this time point. Even in those with poor overall recovery, there appears to be an initial decrease in symptoms to some extent in this early post-injury period. Recently, three distinct clinical recovery pathways following whiplash injury were identified using trajectory-modelling analysis. The first is a pathway of good recovery, where initial levels of pain-related disability were mild to moderate and recovery was good, with 45% of people predicted to follow this pathway. The second pathway involves initial moderate to severe pain-related disability, with some recovery but with disability levels remaining moderate at 12 months. Around 39% of injured people are predicted to follow this pathway. The third pathway involves initial severe pain-related disability and some recovery to moderate or severe disability.

Figure 1. Predicted Neck Disability Index (NDI) trajectories with 95% confidence limits and predicted probability of membership (%). Suggested cut-offs for the NDI are: 0 to 8% (no pain and disability); 10–28% (mild pain and disability), 30–48% (moderate pain and disability), 50–68% (severe pain and disability) and >70% complete disability. Modified from Sterling et al10 with permission.

16% of individuals predicted to follow this pathway. The identified pathways are illustrated in Figure 1. They may provide useful conceptualisation for clinicians of the possible recovery trajectories.

With up to 50% of those sustaining a whiplash injury reporting ongoing pain and disability, it is of clinical interest to be able to identify both those at risk of poor recovery and those who will recover well. This may assist in targeting ever-shrinking health resources to those in most need of them. The most consistent risk factors for poor recovery are initially higher levels of reported pain and initially higher levels of disability. A recent meta-analysis indicated that initial pain scores of >5.5 on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 and scores of >29% on the Neck Disability Index are useful cut-off scores for clinical use. In view of the consistency of these two factors to predict poor functional recovery, they are recommended for use by physiotherapists in the assessment of patients with acute WAD.

Other prognostic factors have been identified, including psychological factors of initial moderate post-traumatic stress symptoms, pain catastrophising and symptoms of depressed mood. Additionally, lower expectations of recovery have been shown to predict poor recovery. In other words, patients who do not expect to recover well may indeed not recover.

Cold hyperalgesia has been shown to predict disability and mental health outcomes at 12 months post-injury, and decreased cold pain tolerance measured with the cold-pressor test predicted ongoing disability. Other sensory measures such as lowered pressure pain thresholds (mechanical hyperalgesia) show inconsistent prognostic capacity.

Walton et al showed that decreased pressure pain thresholds over a distal site in the leg predicted neck pain-related disability at 3 months post-injury, but other studies have shown that this factor is not an independent predictor of later disability. The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic responses are not clearly understood, but are generally acknowledged to reflect augmented nociceptive processing in the central nervous system or central hyperexcitability.

Some factors commonly assessed by physiotherapists do not show prognostic capacity. These factors include measures of motor and sensorimotor function such as the craniocervical flexion test, joint repositioning errors, and balance loss. Decreased range of neck movement is inconsistent in that some studies have found it to be predictive and others have not.

The Quebec Task Force (QTF) classification of whiplash injuries (presented in Table 1) was put forward in 1995 and it remains the classification method still currently used throughout the world. Whilst the QTF system is rather simplistic and based only on signs and symptoms, it allows practitioners and other stakeholders involved in the management of patients with WAD to have a common language about the condition. Most patients fall into the WAD II classification, although health outcomes for this group can be diverse and this has been outlined as one problem with the QTF system. Modifications to the QTF system have been proposed but have generally been more complicated and, for this reason, not easily taken up by all stakeholders involved in the management of WAD.

The diagnosis of WAD has changed little in recent times. In the vast majority of cases, specific tissue damage or a peripheral

For the zygapophyseal joint pathology detected via radiofrequency neurotomy techniques in highly selected patients with chronic WAD, but their prevalence in the general WAD population is not known. It is likely that injury to other structures including cervical discs, ligaments, and nerve tissue is present to varying degrees in some patients.

Current clinical guidelines for the management of acute WAD recommend that radiological imaging be undertaken only to detect WAD grade IV (ie, fracture or dislocation) and that clinicians adhere to the Canadian C-Spine rule or Nexus rule when making the decision to refer the patient for radiographic examination. These rules show very high sensitivity and specificity to detect WAD IV. There is no evidence to support the use of imaging in any form in WAD II. For WAD III (neurological compromise), imaging may be used based on clinical judgement to further evaluate suspected nerve compromise. Thus, the diagnosis of WAD is made on patient-reported symptoms – neck pain and related symptoms following a traumatic event, usually a road traffic crash. In contrast to the lack of progress made in the diagnosis of peripheral pathology, much ground has been made in characterising the condition in terms of its physical and psychological presentation, and some of the key findings in this area have implications for the clinical assessment of WAD, and these will be outlined.

# Table 1

|Quebec Task Force (QTF) classification of whiplash associated disorders.|Clinical presentation|
|---|---|
|grade 0|No complaint about neck pain No physical signs|
|grade I|Neck complaint of pain, stiffness or tenderness only No physical signs|
|grade II|Neck complaint Musculoskeletal signs including: - decreased range of movement|

It is mandatory that pain and disability be measured as the first step of clinical assessment due to their consistent prognostic capacity. Guideline-recommended pain measures include the 11-point visual analogue scale or numeric rating scale, and the recommended measure of disability is the Neck Disability Index due its clinimetric properties. However, other measures are also acceptable, and some include the Whiplash Disability Questionnaire and the Patient Specific Functional Scale.

It is also important to gain an understanding of any psychological factors that may influence recovery or the effects of physiotherapy interventions. Numerous psychological questionnaires are available so it is often difficult for clinicians to decide on the most appropriate questionnaire/s to use. One suggestion is to select relevant questionnaires based on the patient’s reported symptoms in the subjective examination. For example, early symptoms of post-traumatic stress may be suspected in patients who report difficulty sleeping due to thoughts about the accident, flashbacks, or avoidance of driving due to fear. These symptoms can be further evaluated using validated questionnaires, with the Impact of Events Scale recommended for use by physiotherapists. A score of 25 or 26 on the Impact of Events Scale indicates a moderate level of symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Similarly, if from the patient history and interview, it appears that other psychological factors are present, these can also be further evaluated.

their availability. Management decisions made on the basis of responses on these questionnaires depend on the stage of the condition, whether acute or chronic, and this will be discussed below.

# Physical examination

The physical examination of the patient with WAD follows the same general examination procedures usually adopted for the examination of any cervical spine condition but with some additional procedures included based on research findings of WAD. One aim of the physical examination is to determine the grade of the condition using the QTF classification system. A Grade II condition will have physical signs of decreased range of neck movement and palpable ‘tenderness’ compared to Grade I, where the patient reports neck pain but with no physical signs. Grade III is determined via the presence of clinical neurological signs of decreased muscle strength, deep tendon reflexes, and sensation in a dermatomal or myotomal distribution. It should be noted that many patients with WAD will report diffuse symptoms of sensory loss or gain and generalised muscle weakness, both of which may be bilateral, but these findings do not necessarily indicate peripheral nerve compromise and may be a reflection of altered central nociceptive processes.

Much research has focused on the investigation of nociceptive processes in WAD. Systematic reviews conclude that there is strong evidence for the presence of augmented central nervous system processing of nociception in chronic WAD and moderate evidence that cold hyperalgesia (a likely indicator of these processes) is associated with poor recovery from the injury. Clinically, central hyperexcitability may be suspected from subjective reports of the patient, including: reports of allodynia, high irritability of pain, cold sensitivity, and poor sleep due to pain, amongst others. Further assessment of these symptoms may be undertaken using a validated questionnaire such as the self-reported Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs to assess for a neuropathic pain component. Physical tests may include the use of pressure algometers, pain with the application of ice, or with demonstrated increased bilateral responses to the brachial plexus provocation test. Physiotherapists may need to be aware of the presence of such findings because preliminary evidence suggests that patients with chronic WAD and generalised sensitivity to the stimuli may not respond as well to physical rehabilitation and, as outlined previously, cold hyperalgesia is a predictor of poor recovery.

In recent years, there has also been extensive research undertaken demonstrating movement, muscle, and motor control changes in the neck and shoulder girdles of patients with neck pain, including WAD. Study findings include inferior performance on tests of motor control involving the cervical flexor, extensor and scapular muscle groups when compared to asymptomatic control participants; changes in muscle morphology of the cervical flexor and extensor muscles; loss of strength and endurance of cervical and scapular muscle groups; and sensorimotor changes manifested by increased joint re-positioning errors, poor kinaesthetic awareness, altered eye movement control, and loss of balance. Detailed information on the clinical assessment of cervical motor function is available elsewhere. The rationale for the evaluation of such features is to plan an individualised exercise program for each patient based on the assessment findings.

# Management

The management of WAD varies to some extent depending upon whether the condition is in the early acute stages (usually defined as 0–12 weeks) or a chronic condition has already developed (>12 weeks post-injury). These time frames are arbitrary, but are used because they are consistent with current guidelines for the management of WAD. The clinical course of WAD, where most recovery occurs in the first 2–3 months, is important because this time frame offers the opportunity to potentially prevent the development of a chronic condition. As both physical and psychological factors are present in both acute and chronic WAD and there is evidence of close relationships between these factors, management approaches should be in accordance with the current biopsychosocial model. Surprisingly for a condition that incurs significant personal and economic burden, there have been relatively few trials of treatment compared to some other musculoskeletal pain conditions.

Exercise and activity

The mainstay of management for acute WAD is the provision of advice encouraging return to usual activity and exercise, and this approach is advocated in current clinical guidelines. Various types of exercise have been investigated, including range-of-movement exercises, McKenzie exercises, postural exercises, and strengthening and motor control exercises. However, the treatment effects of exercise are generally small, with recent systematic reviews concluding that there is only modest evidence available supporting activity/exercise for acute WAD. It is not clear which type of exercise is more effective or if specific exercise is more effective than general activity or merely advice to remain active. Nevertheless, activity and exercise are superior to restricting movement with a soft collar, where there is strong evidence that immobilisation (collars, rest) is ineffective for the management of acute WAD.

Inspection of data from clinical trials reveals that despite active approaches being superior to rest, a significant proportion of people still develop chronic pain and disability. This was also the case in a recent randomised trial conducted in emergency departments of UK hospitals. The results of the trial demonstrated that six sessions of physiotherapy (a multimodal approach of exercise and manual therapy) was only slightly more effective than a single session of advice from a physiotherapist. However, only 45–50% of participants in either treatment group reported their condition as being ‘much better’ or ‘better’ at short- (4 months) and long-term follow-up (12 months) – a low recovery rate that is little different to the usual natural recovery following the injury.

Whilst there may be a slightly greater number of treatment trials for chronic WAD than acute WAD, they are still sparse compared to other musculoskeletal conditions. A recent systematic review identified only 22 randomised trials that met the criteria for inclusion, and only 12 were of good quality. The authors concluded that exercise programs are effective at relieving pain, although it does not appear that these gains are maintained over the long term. Similar to the situation with acute WAD, it is not clear if one form of exercise is more effective than another. For example, a graded functional exercise approach and advice demonstrated greater improvements in pain intensity, pain bothersomeness and functional ability, compared to advice alone. In another trial, similar effects were demonstrated when the exercise investigated was a specific motor and sensorimotor retraining program for the cervical spine combined with manual therapy. Other studies have investigated muscle strength and endurance training, vestibular exercises, and exercises designed to challenge the postural system, with similar effects regardless of the exercise type.

In a preliminary investigation, one randomised trial explored factors that may moderate the effects of a predominantly exercise-based intervention and found that participants with both cold and mechanical hyperalgesia did not respond to the intervention. However, these findings are limited by the small sample size and

# Invited Topical Review

have not been replicated in a larger trial. So at present it is not clear which patients will respond to exercise approaches.

From a clinical perspective, exercise and activity should be used in the treatment of both acute and chronic WAD. However, there is no evidence to indicate that one form of exercise is superior to another and this is an area that requires further research. The generally small effect sizes with exercise suggest that either additional treatments will be needed, or that it is a sub-group of patients who show a better response. However, due to a lack of evidence, it is not clear which additional treatments should be included or how to clearly identify responders and non-responders. Thus, the recommendation to clinicians is that health outcomes should be monitored and treatment continued only when there is clear improvement. In patients whose condition is not improving, the clinician will need to look for other factors that may be involved, such as psychological, environmental, or nociceptive processing factors amongst others.

Education and advice

Various information and educational approaches including information booklets, websites and videos have been investigated for their effectiveness in improving outcomes following whiplash injury. In one trial, an educational video of advice focusing on activation was more beneficial in decreasing WAD symptoms than no treatment at 24 weeks follow-up (outcome: no/mild symptoms vs moderate/severe symptoms), RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.06), but not at 52 weeks, RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.21). The results of other trials were equivocal and overall none of the interventions studied reduced the proportion of patients who developed chronic WAD. Currently, there appears to be wide variability in the nature of information and advice provided to a patient, suggesting that the best educational approaches as well as strategies for behaviour change and system change are yet to be established. Although patients understandably want advice on the prognosis and implications of their injury, it is not clear that advice per se will improve long-term outcomes or prevent chronic pain development. There have been no trials of educational interventions for chronic WAD, but approaches that teach patients about pain neurophysiology have shown some effect in other chronic pain conditions and may also be useful in the management of WAD.

Spinal manual therapy

Spinal manual therapy is commonly used in the clinical management of neck pain. It is difficult to tease out the effects of manual therapy alone because most studies have used it as part of a multimodal package of treatment. Systematic reviews of the few trials that have assessed manual therapy techniques alone conclude that manual therapy applied to the cervical spine (passive mobilisation) may provide some benefit in reducing pain, but that the included trials were of low quality. One low-quality trial found that manipulative thrust techniques to the thoracic spine added to multimodal physiotherapy treatment resulted in a greater reduction of pain than multimodal physiotherapy alone, but the effect was small (SMD −0.68, 95% CI −1.11 to −0.25). There have been no randomised controlled trials of spinal manual therapy alone for chronic WAD. In view of the current evidence, clinical guidelines advocate that manual therapy can be used in conjunction with exercise and advice, if there is evidence of continued benefit via validated outcome measures.

Medication

Whilst not traditionally a physiotherapy treatment, physiotherapists often recommend over-the-counter medications to patients or communicate with the patient’s general practitioner regarding the need for medication. For acute WAD, it would seem logical that, as with any acute injury or trauma, the provision of pain medication in the early stages would be appropriate, particularly considering that initial higher levels of pain are associated with poor recovery from whiplash injury and that features indicative of central hyperexcitability are common. Yet there have been very few trials of medication in acute WAD. One early study showed that intravenous infusion of methylprednisolone provided in a hospital emergency department for acute whiplash resulted in fewer sick days over 6 months and less pain-related disability than those who received placebo medication. Whilst this is an interesting finding, it would not be feasible in primary care settings and may have potentially harmful effects. In a recent randomised controlled trial, little pain relief was obtained from muscle relaxants either alone or combined with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for emergency department patients with acute whiplash. There have also been few trials of medication for chronic WAD. This is in contrast to other conditions such as low back pain and fibromyalgia, the latter of which shows a similar sensory presentation to chronic WAD. Current clinical guidelines recommend, on consensus, that general pain management guidelines are followed for the provision of medication to patients with acute and chronic WAD until further evidence becomes available.

Interdisciplinary approaches

As can be seen from the evidence outlined above, there are currently few effective treatments available for acute WAD. One reason proposed for this is that a ‘one size fits all’ approach has been used, and this is sub-optimal as it ignores the well-documented heterogeneity of WAD. There are now many data demonstrating that other factors shown to be present in acute WAD and associated with poor recovery may need to be considered in the early management of the condition. In particular, these include the sensory presentation of WAD, which allows some understanding of nociceptive processes involved, and psychological factors that may impede recovery. A recent high-quality randomised trial investigated if the early targeting of these factors would provide better outcomes than usual care. Participants with acute WAD (≤4 weeks duration) were assessed using measures of pain, disability, sensory function and psychological factors, including general distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Treatment was tailored to the findings of this baseline assessment and could range from a multimodal physiotherapy approach of advice, exercise and manual therapy for those with few signs of central hyperexcitability and psychological distress to an interdisciplinary intervention comprising medication (if pain levels were greater than moderate and signs of central hyperexcitability were present) and cognitive behavioural therapy delivered by a clinical psychologist (if scores on psychological questionnaires were above threshold). This pragmatic intervention approach was compared to usual care where the patient could pursue treatment as they normally would. Analysis revealed no significant differences in frequency of recovery (defined as Neck Disability Index <8%) between pragmatic and usual-care groups at 6 months or 12 months. There was no improvement in non-recovery rates at 6 months, indicating no advantage of the early interdisciplinary intervention. Several possible reasons for these results were proposed. The design of the trial may have been too broad and not sensitive enough to detect changes in sub-groups of patients, suggesting better outcomes would be achieved by specifically selecting patients at high risk of poor recovery. With a clinical prediction rule now developed for WAD and undergoing

Validation, this approach can be evaluated in future trials. Additionally, 61% of participants in the trial found the medication (low-dose opioids and/or adjuvant agents) to be unacceptable due to side effects such as dizziness and drowsiness, and did not comply with the prescribed dose, indicating that more acceptable medications need to be evaluated. Compliance with attending sessions with the clinical psychologist was less than compliance with physiotherapy, perhaps indicating patient preference for physiotherapy.

In accordance with the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain, it may be expected that management involving only physical therapy for chronic WAD will not be sufficient. Few trials of interdisciplinary approaches have been conducted in a chronic WAD group, and these approaches have been varied, from physiotherapists delivering psychological-type interventions in addition to physiotherapy to psychological interventions alone. In their systematic review, Teasell et al concluded that although the majority of studies suggest that interdisciplinary interventions are beneficial, it is difficult to formulate conclusions given the heterogeneity of the interventions. Since that review, additional trials have investigated psychological approaches for chronic WAD. Dunne and colleagues showed that trauma-focussed cognitive behavioural therapy provided to individuals with chronic WAD and post-traumatic stress disorder led to decreased psychological symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, as well as decreased pain-related disability. Although preliminary, the results of this study suggest that psychological interventions may be useful to improve not only psychological symptoms, but also pain-related disability.

From a clinical perspective, some individuals with WAD will report various psychological symptoms, particularly those with an already chronic condition. Psychological symptoms may be related to pain, for example, pain catastrophising, pain-related fear, pain coping strategies and other symptoms related to the traumatic event itself (road traffic crash), such as post-traumatic stress symptoms or post-traumatic stress disorder. Additionally, there is emerging evidence that feelings of injustice associated with the accident or compensation system may also be present. Such factors will need to be evaluated in the clinical assessment of patients with WAD (see Table 2). If confident, the physiotherapist may then decide to manage them as part of their treatment plan or to initiate appropriate referral. This may be to the patient’s general practitioner or a clinical psychologist for further assessment of the psychological symptoms. The decision to refer or not can be made via relevant questionnaires, with high scores indicating referral may be necessary and psychologically informed physiotherapy treatment for more moderate scores, but with reassessment and referral if no improvement is made.

Future directions

An important aim for the treatment of acute WAD is the identification of people at risk of poor recovery, and to then prevent the development of chronic pain and disability. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence available to guide the clinician to achieve this goal, and this is frustrating for clinicians and researchers alike. Whilst there is now much better understanding of the characteristics of the condition and factors predictive of poor recovery, much less progress has been made in the development of improved and effective interventions. The logical next step in the research process is to target these factors, many of which are potentially modifiable, with more specific interventions.

Education and advice to return to activity and exercise will still remain the cornerstones of early treatment for WAD, but they require further investigation to determine the most effective form of exercise, dose, and ways to deliver these approaches. Activity and exercise will likely be sufficient for patients at low risk of developing chronic pain, although this is yet to be formally tested. Those patients at medium or high risk of poor recovery will likely need additional treatments to the basic advice/activity/exercise approach. This may include medication to target pain and nociceptive processes as well as methods to address early psychological responses to injury. As was seen in the aforementioned interdisciplinary trial for acute WAD, this is not so easy to achieve. The participants of this trial not only found the side effects of medication unacceptable, but also were less compliant with attendance to a clinical psychologist (46% of participants attended fewer than 4 of 10 sessions) compared to attendance with the physiotherapist (12% attended fewer than four sessions over 10 weeks). It is possible that people with acute whiplash injury see themselves as having a ‘physical’ injury and thus, are more accepting of physiotherapy. The burden of requiring visits with several practitioners may also lead to poor compliance. Physiotherapists may be the health care providers best placed to deliver psychological interventions for acute WAD. This approach has been investigated in mainly chronic conditions such as arthritis, and recently, in the management of acute low back pain, with results showing some early promise. This is not to say that patients with a diagnosed psychopathology such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder should be managed by physiotherapists, and of course, these patients will require referral to an appropriately trained professional.

Physiotherapists may also need to take a greater role in the overall care plan of the patient with acute WAD. This would mean having expertise in the assessment of risk factors and an understanding of when additional treatments such as medication and psychological interventions are required. Whilst this has traditionally been the role of general practitioners, it is difficult to see how the busy structure of medical primary care will allow for the appropriate assessment of patients to first identify those at risk, develop a treatment plan, follow the patient’s progress, and modify treatment as necessary.

In the case of chronic WAD, more effective interventions need development and testing. It is becoming clear that management approaches that focus predominantly on physical rehabilitation are achieving only small effect sizes. However, it is important for the long-term general health of patients that they undertake regular activity and exercise, and it is a concern if chronic pain prevents them from doing this. Randomised controlled trials are needed that combine activity/exercise approaches with other interventions such as psychological approaches, educational approaches and medication. The optimal combination and dosage of such approaches will need to be determined.

WAD, whether acute or chronic, is a challenging and complex condition. With clear evidence emerging of a myriad of physical and psychological factors occurring to varying degrees in individual patients, it is also clear that practitioners involved in the management of WAD need specific skills in this area. Physiotherapists are the health care providers who likely see the greatest number of patients with WAD, and by virtue of the health system set-up, spend the most time with these patients. Physiotherapists are well placed to take on a coordination or ‘gatekeeper’ role in the management of WAD and research into health services models that include physiotherapists in such a role is also needed.

# Editorial

Is it time to reframe how we care for people with non-traumatic musculoskeletal pain?

Jeremy Lewis,1,2 Peter O’Sullivan3,4

# THE CURRENT APPROACH TO MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IS FAILING

The majority of persistent non-traumatic musculoskeletal pain disorders do not have a pathoanatomical diagnosis that adequately explains the individual’s pain experience and disability. We contend this has resulted in two concerning developments in the management of people with such disorders. First, structural changes observed on imaging that are highly prevalent in pain free populations, such as rotator cuff tears, intervertebral disc degeneration, labral tears and cartilage changes, are ascribed to individuals as a diagnosis for their condition. In this context, this information may result in the individual believing that their body is damaged, fragile and in need of protection, resulting in a cascade of movement and activity avoidance behaviors and seeking interventions to correct the structural deficits. This trend has led to exponential increases in elective surgery rates and associated costs, while the efficacy of repairing (eg, rotator cuff and medical meniscal tears), reshaping (eg, subacromial decompression) or replacing (eg, lumbar intervertebral discs) the structures considered to be at fault has been substantially challenged. Second, it is arguable that musculoskeletal clinicians have invented treatments for conditions that may not exist or be readily detected (such as trigger points, sacral torsions), and they have developed and perpetuated treatment paradigms (such as ‘correcting’ upper body posture and muscle imbalances) that do not conform to current research evidence.

# WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF OTHER CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS?

Contemporary evidence demonstrates that many musculoskeletal pain conditions are associated with long term disability that are often resistant to current treatments. They are influenced by multiple interacting factors, including genetics, psychological, social and biophysical factors, comorbidities and lifestyle. We propose that when these conditions become persistent and disabling they should be viewed in a similar way to other chronic health conditions. For example, when an individual presents with non-insulin dependent diabetes, best practice would involve an interview and examination where a diagnosis is reached and the relevant biopsychosocial contributing factors to the disorder are identified. Based on this, education, advice and shared decision making, a management plan, underpinned with empathy and support, would be agreed. This plan would typically involve highlighting the importance of good sleep hygiene, the role of nutrition and diet, stress management and, if relevant, cessation or reduction of smoking. The profound benefits of participating in appropriate graduated physical activity would be emphasized and, if necessary, medication, such as metformin, may also be prescribed. It also involves the management of comorbid health complaints. While, if required, the prescribed medicine would differ, the management of other chronic disorders, such as asthma and high blood pressure, would follow a similar process.

# OBSTACLES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS APPROACH

We need to reframe what is currently doable and achievable in the management of many non-traumatic musculoskeletal presentations, and honest and open conversations regarding the outcome evidence for these disorders needs to be sensitively communicated. There would be many obstacles to overcome and respect when considering such an approach. For clinicians, these might be pain beliefs, professional identity, time, financial pressures and lack of adequate training. Patient beliefs and expectations may also pose a significant challenge for clinicians, especially when they desire a structural diagnosis and a

# Abstract

Keywords: Communication, Qualitative research, Physical therapy modalities, Referral and consultation

Background: Person-centred approaches to care require clinicians to engage in trying to understand the full range of problems and concerns, treatment and investigation requests, and emotional and social issues that people bring to the consultation. If, however, the main issues of importance are not openly declared and discussed they cannot be addressed. This is likely to result in people receiving the care that clinicians think they need, rather than care based on individual needs and preferences.

Objective: To understand people's abilities to express the issues of importance to them within a consultation and clinicians' abilities to acknowledge and address those issues.

Design: A qualitative study using an interpretive phenomenological approach.

Methods: Fifteen people and their physiotherapists were interviewed and their consultations recorded. The resulting data sets were analysed to identify and report themes within the data.

Findings: The findings revealed that people present with what are often simple issues, but which are sometimes expressed in an unstructured way in clinical encounters and are often difficult for clinicians to establish. Three linked themes emerged: (1) clear versus unstructured agendas; (2) people need information and understanding; and (3) developing a sense of collaboration.

Conclusions: The issues of importance that people bring to a consultation are varied and often vague. This research highlights the importance of communication to elicit, identify and address the issues of importance to people in clinical encounters to ensure a positive experience and outcome for both the individual person and clinician.

Tweetable Abstract: Achieving desirable health outcomes is more likely when people are supported to think about their priorities and ‘what matters to them’.

# Introduction

Traditionally the practice of many physiotherapists has been characterised by a strongly biomedical paradigm, involving a process of reasoning or problem solving that leads to the formulation of a diagnosis and/or ‘problem list’ and often a clinician-centred symptom-focused treatment plan.

In recent years the ‘biopsychosocial’ model of care has acquired popularity in response to mounting research evidence that the appreciation of health and illness requires clinicians to try to understand the full range of problems and concerns, treatment and investigation requests, and emotional and social issues that people bring to the consultation (Foster and Delitto, 2011). A person-centred approach involves sharing control of the consultation, and some models have introduced the concept of ‘agendas’ as the key to understanding people (Levenstein et al., 1986).

Encouraging individuals to voice their agendas or what matters most to them allows the clinician to develop an understanding of them as a person in terms of their individual needs and problems, and is dependent on the style of communication adopted by the clinician. However developing a true partnership in a health care consultation can prove challenging as the dominant culture of ‘clinician knows best’ means that people are often reluctant to declare their views and opinions (Frosch et al., 2012).

Health professionals need complex interpersonal and communication skills, as well as technical expertise. Communication is a skill which is seen as a key professional competence. The culture of current physiotherapy practice has called for collaboration and a sharing of

# Method

Research into communication typically focuses on data collected from observations or interviews. In a person/clinician encounter the interactions are interdependent and are likely to influence each other. The use of interviews alone can lead to potential biases such as socially desirable responses or obtaining generalised views. Therefore to achieve a complete picture of the physiotherapy consultation both clinicians and people were interviewed, along with the consultation being digitally recorded (Barry et al., 2001).

# Sample and data collection

Fifteen data sets were generated within a musculoskeletal service within one trust in South West England. We purposively sampled 15 of 28 (54%) clinicians who responded positively to an e-mail outlining the research and inviting them to participate. This purposive sample was chosen to represent different genders, clinic locations and grading of staff.

We then recruited 15 people referred for physiotherapy over the age of 18 years through the administration staff in the booking office when they booked appointments with clinicians who had already been recruited (one per clinician). Clinicians were not involved in any way in the recruitment of participants. The principal recruitment criteria were people presenting with musculoskeletal pain who were able to communicate in the English language. Individuals who expressed an interest were provided with a participant information sheet and gave informed written consent. Their characteristics are displayed in Table 1.

Only two of the people approached declined to take part in the study, citing a lack of time as the main reason. This total sample size was

# Analysis

Data was analysed manually by the first author (RS) based on a thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006), guided by the principles of Gadamerian hermeneutics; linking the different data sources, before looking for common themes across the data. The specific process for interpretation of the data is set out in Table 3. A tentative analysis of each data set was undertaken as the hermeneutic texts were assembled, but a more detailed analysis was performed once all the data had been collected. To ensure dependability, a second author (SP) facilitated refinement of the thematic analysis through peer review and auditing (Seale, 1999). In some qualitative methodologies data saturation is

chosen based on views of Creswell (1998) that in phenomenological studies a sample size of between 5 and 25 was sufficient.

The sequence of interviews wip clinicians and people referred for physioperapy
1. Pre-consultation interview wip person referred for physioperapy
2. Consultation audio-taped
3. Post-consultation interview wip person referred for physioperapy
4. Post-consultation interview wip clinician

The sequence of data collection is given in Table 2, which consisted of person interviews in the clinic immediately before and after the consultation with the clinicians. Consultations ranged from 20 to 45 min. Clinician interviews about these consultations were undertaken at a convenient time later on the same day. Interviews and consultations were digitally recorded and transcribed. The first author (RS), a male physiotherapist with extensive musculoskeletal experience and seven years' experience as a qualitative researcher, conducted the interviews. Topic guides were used to guide the interviews and adapted in light of emerging findings in line with an inductive approach. The topic guides addressed issues of importance concerning factors such as presenting problem and symptoms; diagnosis theories and understanding; individuals' reactions to their referral; clinicians' behaviours; wanted and unwanted activities or treatments; and emotional or social issues such as fears and concerns.

|1. Creating the texts:|Listening, reading and being immersed in each participant's text.|
|2. Identifying interesting features:|Making notes of initial ideas and interesting features in the texts.|
|3. Initial coding:|A hermeneutic view resists the idea that there can be one single reading of a text. To increase the rigour of analysis a three stage iterative process was undertaken: Firstly an analysis of the type and range of issues of importance voiced by the participants in the pre-consultation interviews and choosing codes to capture the meaning in the texts was conducted. This was then compared to what was voiced in the consultations and finally compared to which issues of importance voiced (and unvoiced) in the consultations were addressed by the clinicians. A final coding based on a conclusive interpretation was written. Coding tables for each of the participants were then constructed with the corresponding data extracts.|

# 5. Findings

Of the people referred for physiotherapy recruited for this study, no one had only one issue of importance, presenting with a range of two to five topics that they wished to discuss. Sixteen different items of importance were identified. The top five items and the percentage that were voiced and addressed by the clinicians are shown in Table 4. Others have not been reported due to the very small numbers and often individual nature of the remaining issues.

Three main themes relating to the issues of importance that people bring to a consultation and how they were elicited and addressed were formed.

# 5.1. Theme: 1 clear versus unstructured agendas

Some of the issues were very open and well-defined and had clearly been identified by people before the pre-consultation interviews, whereas for others they only surfaced during the pre-consultation interviews as they started to talk, suggesting some people had difficulty formulating questions and considering the topics of importance to them prior to their initial consultation. At one end of the spectrum was a well-informed person who expressed their preference clearly and directly, for example Participant 7, who presented with a single concern, requesting surgical treatment for a previously diagnosed problem.

"What I am expecting is to finish up with surgery. I want my right hand to be as good as my left". (Participant 7: Pre-consultation interview)

At the other end of the spectrum were consultations where the issues of importance were less clearly defined, suggesting that some people may have needed support and preparation to take part in a different type of consultation. Improving activation and preparation is likely to result in more meaningful conversations between people and clinicians.

"I wasn't sure if he knew exactly why he was here and I did try and pin him down a little bit on that and said what would make this a good outcome for you today or you know what are you hoping to get and he didn't really have an answer" (Participant 12: Post-consultation interview with clinician).

For some people their apparent lack of understanding as to why they had been referred or what service they had been referred to may have inhibited their ability to engage. As a consequence some appeared quite 'passive' or disengaged in the pre-consultation interviews, with a third of the participants initially stating that they had no real expectations of their visit.

"I have no expectations I have got an open mind about it you know." (Participant 4: Pre-consultation interview)

"Not an awful lot to be honest I thought I was going to see a physiotherapist, and I just wondered what that was going to do" (Participant 9: Pre-consultation interview)

"I don't know what to expect, because they're the medical expertise [sic] I'm not" (Participant 5: Pre-consultation interview)

This cultural norm of peoples' deference to the perceived knowledge of the experts can be difficult to overcome. However in the case of Participant 5, although they initially appeared very 'passive', the approach of the clinician inviting interaction and participation in the consultation led to the person expressing satisfaction with the clinician's approach.

"I felt comfortable and I wasn't being rushed" (Participant 5: Post-consultation interview)

For this person, despite some initial uncertainty, the potential development of trust and confidence in the relationship ultimately resulted in issues of importance 'surfacing'.

"What is actually causing this muscle pain, if it is muscle pain, or if it's anything else?"(Participant 5: Consultation with clinician)

"What can I do to make things a bit easier for myself basically?"

# 5.2. Theme 2: people need information and understanding

A lack of understanding may be the reason why some people feel restricted in their role and have trouble formulating their thoughts or requests and identifying clear issues of importance. In this study the people frequently reported lack of understanding, such that information and an explanation of their condition and a diagnosis was one of the main issues of importance that emerged for all but one participant.

“Firstly I'm hoping from her experience that she may be able to give me a better evaluation of what it could be, narrowing it down a bit instead of the doctors saying ‘It could be this, it could be that” (Participant 6: Pre-consultation interview).

“Well I've just been hoping to present my symptoms, perhaps get a firmer diagnosis” (Participant 13: Pre-consultation interview).

Overall the findings further underline the importance people place on provision of information about their condition. A ‘crash course’ in explaining the diagnosis, its treatment options, outcomes and evidence takes time and energy from the health system, and a number of people in this study voiced disappointment at the lack of information given to them by the various health care professionals they had consulted.

“I'm hoping you might know a little bit more than the GPs would, hopefully with your experience and knowledge, as they don't seem to have a clue.” (Participant 6: Consultation with clinician)

“I've been to see three different doctors I've never seen the same one and they've all sort of brushed it aside. I don't think they are taking me seriously” (Participant 9: Pre-consultation interview)

They also expressed satisfaction when this need was effectively addressed.

“It was great; she (clinician) examined me for a start, which hasn't really happened. Um yeah she examined me, she explained a lot whilst she was doing it as well and um sort of gave me more of an understanding of the mechanics of the back.” (Participant 10: Post-consultation interview)

“I want to know that there's nothing, I don't know what you call it … serious.” (Participant 5: Pre-consultation interview)

However despite the person failing to voice these concerns in the consultation, the clinician offered reassurance by saying:

“It is definitely nothing unusual or anything worrying going on.” (Participant 5: Consultation with clinician)

All of the participants were able to impart their symptoms, but in two cases the clinicians, having elicited information on the main symptoms of concern, then failed to acknowledge or pay selective attention to this information when management decisions were being made. In the case of Participant 2, he was particularly concerned about some persistent pins and needles and not the pain which was resolving.

“I'm still getting the pins and needles; it's numb on the thumb and the finger but it's the pins and needles that bother me, the pain is only a very dull ache now.” (Participant 2: Consultation with clinician)

Interestingly the clinician, despite clearly picking up on this, still focused their treatment on addressing the pain aspect of the person's complaint.

“The main problem was, mainly kind of pins and needles in his fingers, but also some of the pain that was going down his arm which kind of has resolved. But I suppose more so now the pins and needles in his fingers I guess.” (Participant 2: Post-consultation interview with clinician)

# 5.3. Theme 3: developing a sense of collaboration

As can be seen from Table 4 the clinicians addressed a majority of the issues that people brought to the consultations, including on occasions issues that people failed to voice in that consultation. The attitudes, skills and behaviors of healthcare providers can have a significant impact on the extent to which people feel engaged and supported to manage the social, emotional and physical impacts of their condition.

The clinicians in this study used a range of open-ended questions to try and engage the person as an active partner and establish their focus for the consultation, for example:

For some people it was clear that the value of this information was perhaps to provide reassurance and allay fears or uncertainties about the cause of their problem which was arguably greater for some than their desire to receive a therapeutic intervention.

“You know I am quite scared when I have one of these attacks because it is quite severe. Um … and I want to know I suppose that it’s nothing more serious” (Participant 1: Pre-consultation interview)

“Um, I'd like my mind put at rest that there's nothing sinister going on to be honest and that only really stems from the fact that as soon as you get past the 50 stage you become high risk for all these things” (Participant 10: Pre-consultation interview)

People need evidence-based information just as much as clinicians do, which might help to avoid the problem of poor quality care. It could also help to counter misplaced perceptions about treatment and investigation needs, management options and likely outcomes. Participants presented with an array of information needs which included: diagnosis (including reassurance that it was not due to a sinister cause, likely recurrence and prognosis), exercise and activity (including the likelihood of exacerbating the problem), and the impact of the problem (on current or future work and hobbies).

Although some of these information needs were only partly voiced by the participants, they were still often addressed by the clinicians almost as a matter of routine. This particularly applied to issues of concern regarding the cause of the presenting problem. For example Participant 5 in the pre-consultation interview said:

“So what are your thoughts on today in terms of what you wanted to talk about or ask about?” (Participant 7: Consultation with clinician)

“What are your thoughts about being here and what I can do for you?” (Participant 10: Consultation with clinician)

“What are you hoping to gain from coming to physiotherapy?” (Participant 1: Consultation with clinician)

A number of people also talked about positive, ‘person-centered’ behaviors and approaches that they had experienced, which helped to develop trust and confidence in their relationship with the clinician.

“Um, it felt like a collaborative process, it didn't feel like she was not listening to what I felt or needed and she had her own agenda, it definitely wasn't like that.” (Participant 1: Post-consultation interview)

“He did explain, talked to me like a human being, like a person not you know, some stupid female, kind of thing, he made me feel at ease” (Participant 8: Post-consultation interview)

“Yes I told her that I had these just worries about things like ovarian cancer, sometimes you feel silly saying that to people and it's nice if somebody doesn't make you feel silly when you say it” (Participant 10: Post-consultation interview)

This sense of partnership working where both parties feel safe in communicating with each other is key to achieving a positive clinical outcome, and should be regarded as a core element of professional expertise.
---
# 6. Discussion

Consultation skills within the physiotherapy profession are under-explored and still overlooked when compared to development and evaluation of technical treatment skills. Effective communication is vital in ensuring a positive experience and outcome for both people and clinician. Healthcare increasingly emphasises the need to empower and engage people, and for consultations to be conducted in partnership (Bodenheimer et al., 2002). One of the most important tasks in the clinical encounter is for the clinician to accurately identify a person's agenda or “issues of importance”, as this allows the clinician to engage with the person's perspective, develop trust and to work in a person-centred manner.

Participation in clinical encounters depends on a complex interplay of personal, clinical and contextual factors. The strongest predictors of a person's participation are the clinical setting and the clinician's communicative style (Street et al., 2005), whose origins lie in the person-centred approach where the clinical agenda is located firmly in the person's experience thereby making it meaningful and relevant to them.

In this study a comprehensive understanding of the issues that mattered most to people was only achieved through adopting a methodology that invited people to portray their full selves. By using a qualitative research method that was person-centred and structured closer to the lifeworld a deeper more multifaceted view of people's ideas, concerns, expectations, relationship with clinicians and lived experience of their problems prior to and during the physiotherapy encounter was gained.

By accessing experiences of the physiotherapists and people, in hermeneutic terms the author was able to use their experiences to discuss key factors relating to what really mattered to the patients. This allowed for the Hermeneutic Circle to be experienced and through such feedback and subsequent dialogue shared understandings reached.

In particular the findings highlight the potential difficulties some people have in fully formulating and discussing topics of importance to them at their initial consultations, as some people may be anxious, forgetful, feel inhibited from asking questions or have low levels of activation (Hibbard et al., 2004). Previous research has noted that people are reluctant to ask questions when they do not understand information related to their medical condition (Arnold et al., 2012). People in this study had a range of between two and five issues to discuss which is in keeping with Byrne and Long (1976) who found that people come with an average of three concerns, and that the initial concern stated is seldom the most important to address. It is important therefore for clinicians to avoid hastily focusing on the first concern raised by the person.

| |Table 4|
|---|---|
| |Most people in this study expected an explanation or an improved understanding of their problem.|

Patient activation relates to an individual's capability in terms of their knowledge, skills and confidence to manage their health. A lack of understanding may be the reason why some people feel restricted in their role and have trouble formulating their thoughts or requests and identifying clear issues of importance. So what matters to a person may depend to some extent on what they already know about their condition. Dealing with lack of understanding of their condition and filling any knowledge gaps is often the first stage and main goal for people with low levels of activation to manage their own healthcare, followed by increasing self-awareness and the role they can play in their management.

The hidden agenda is regarded as one that is known to the person prior to the consultation but remains unvoiced (Barry et al., 2001). Some of the items that went unvoiced in this study were concerns that centered on the need for a diagnosis and for reassurance that the pain was not due to a sinister cause. This was in contrast to the findings of Barry et al. (2001) who noted that people did not generally express fears about the implications of diagnoses or ideas about their symptoms. Some research has focused on how best to structure questions that prompt people to express additional concerns they may have. One approach to do this is to ask the question “anything else?” or “what else?” until the person indicates there is nothing more to discuss (Rodriguez et al., 2008). However Heritage et al. (2007) suggest rephrasing this question as “is there something else you want to address in the visit today?” to more effectively identify a person's concerns. Despite the clinicians frequently demonstrating a range of communication skills and professional experience to try and facilitate people's involvement, there was no evidence of clinicians using such ‘screening’ approaches to elicit people's full agendas. Clinicians need to be sensitive to the range of potential issues that people may bring to a consultation, as well as considering the way in which these items might be elicited.

# 7. Strengths and limitations

This study has several strengths and limitations. One possible limitation is the potential self-selection bias by responding clinicians, meant that those responding might have been more likely to adopt a collaborative approach in consultations. Also the study population were on average older than the general population. Previous work has shown that older people ask fewer questions and often spend less time with their clinician, and on the whole tend to have passive relationships with their clinicians (Mann et al., 2001).

A potential strength of the study was that a more complete picture of communication within the consultation was only possible through a methodology in which both clinicians and people were interviewed, along with a recording of the consultation. It was hoped that by using both interviews and recording the consultation that the potential disparity between how people and clinicians present in clinical practice and how they present in interviews could be reduced. All people have histories, presentations and experiences which are individual, however it became clear early on in the interviews that participants found it challenging to talk freely about issues of importance to them, and despite some initial concerns that the pre-consultation interviews may impact on the conduct of the consultation, this didn't appear to have any significant bearing as they didn't seem to be any better ‘prepared’.

Although this study provides a better understanding of the issues of importance that people bring to the physiotherapy encounter, a relatively small number of participants cannot be considered to be simply representative of a notional, homogenous ‘wider population’ of people presenting with musculoskeletal disorders.

# 8. Conclusion

The findings suggest that the issues of importance that people bring to a physiotherapy consultation are varied and often vague. For this group of people an understanding of their problem appeared to be more valued than other matters. People need to understand their medical conditions in order for them to take an active role in their health care. For the clinician this means it is imperative that they understand pathology and contemporary pain theories as they relate to musculoskeletal pain so that they can engage in positive dialogue with people to address their reported need for an explanation and understanding.

For people, systems and approaches are needed to support them to think about ‘what matters to them’. This may help them to set their priorities for the consultation and engage in more meaningful conversations with clinicians. Achieving desirable health outcomes is more likely when people actively participate in their care. Clinicians also need to be flexible. Responding to each patient as a person is essential as no single dimension of person-centred care exists without reliance on other dimensions. At the centre of this process is effective communication (Cooper et al., 2008) to fully engage the person in the process so that the issues of importance that people bring to a consultation can

# VIEWPOINT

Gregory J. Lehman, MSc, DC, MScPT1

Clinicians and researchers working in the same clinical area (eg, low back pain) often make recommendations on how best to manage patients, and these recommendations are often characterized by different clinical and philosophical approaches that range from biomechanical to psychological. The diversity of models of care in contemporary musculoskeletal physical therapy can be confusing for patients and practicing clinicians. There is, however, a common theme to many of these seemingly disparate models of care: symptom modification.

Symptom modification aims at reducing symptoms and improving function with a variety of clinical approaches. This Viewpoint explores the role of symptom modification in rehabilitation and specifically addresses (1) symptom modification within the kinesiopathological model of pain, (2) symptom modification in clinical practice, and (3) potential commonality in seemingly divergent models of clinical practice.

Clinicians are often confronted with conflicting advice in the literature and from advocates of a particular approach to the treatment of patients in pain. Finding common themes within these seemingly disparate approaches may help to reconcile these differences and potentially delineate commonality in contemporary practice. Symptom modification may serve as the overarching rationale for a variety of techniques and approaches used in contemporary practice.

# Symptom Modification Within the Kinesiopathological Model of Pain

One goal of musculoskeletal practice has been to identify the structure associated with the patient’s pain and symptoms. To achieve this, orthopaedic tests were developed to implicate a source of symptoms. The ability to achieve this goal has been challenged by multiple investigations that suggest that, in isolation or in combination, clinical tests are often incapable of identifying the structure associated with the symptoms with sufficient confidence. In addition, there is generally a poor correlation between the findings of imaging investigations and symptoms in the absence of trauma and sinister pathology. These 2 findings suggest that in many instances, musculoskeletal pain may be structurally and anatomically indeterminable. To address this uncertainty, clinicians and researchers have suggested that clinical practice could be guided by the identification and modification of potential kinematic, kinetic, or motor control impairments in musculoskeletal function, that is, a kinesiopathological approach. The presumption is that the correction of movement to an assumed ideal movement and the correction of proposed impairments are necessary to alleviate pain and promote ideal function.

The identification of an impairment assumes that there is an ideal position or movement pattern and that deviations from this ideal predispose an individual to pain and may negatively impact recovery. A limitation of the kinesiopathological approach is the common research finding of an inconsistent relationship.

Relationship between assumed impairments in posture, kinematics, kinetics, and motor control and pain and disability. For example, altered scapular kinematics are inconsistently linked to shoulder pain, and altered scapular kinematics have been shown to not be predictive of future shoulder pain. Conversely, other research has suggested that deviations in scapular kinematics do predispose athletes to future shoulder pain. A poor relationship between spinal posture and neck pain and shoulder pain has been documented. Similarly, conflicting results have also been reported in the lower limb, with research findings suggesting increased hip adduction being associated with iliotibial band syndrome in runners. Others have reported no relationship, while some suggest that decreased hip adduction is linked with iliotibial band syndrome. Within the same research study, inconsistencies in proposed kinematic flaws and their relationship to injury have also been documented. For example, in recreational runners, increased hip adduction has been prospectively linked to patellofemoral pain, but not to calcaneal eversion or hip internal rotation. The inconsistent relationship between biomechanics and pain challenges the existence of ideal movements and the use of an ideal movement standard to guide clinical decisions.

Further, while the process of attempting to change presumed kinematic or kinetic impairments or movement behaviors may be helpful in decreasing pain and disability, this is not always associated with changes in the assumed kinesiological dysfunction. For example, studies investigating shoulder kinematics following exercise interventions designed to change joint kinematics have often shown improvements in symptoms with little to no change in joint kinematics. This Viewpoint recognizes that the clinical approach of changing movement parameters and assumed impairments may enjoy clinical success; therefore, an alternative rationale for changing movement behaviors and guiding changes in movement may be warranted, considering that the correction of the assumed impairment may not occur and may be unnecessary.

Symptom Modification in Clinical Practice

Many approaches that use symptom modification have been based, in part, in a biomechanical/kinesiopathological paradigm, where it is assumed that pain may be a result of restricted joint movement, suboptimal alignment/control of anatomical structures, excessive structural loads, lack of stability, or inability to relax muscles during movement. Treatment based on changes in movement behaviors, and thus biomechanics, justifies the movement corrections based on symptom response alone. Across different treatment models, the hypotheses underpinning the models and the application of the procedures may appear polarized and contradictory. For example, to reduce lumbar symptoms, some modification models recommend bracing and others recommend relaxing the lumbar spine during functional activities, such as bending or squatting. Many approaches to symptom modification are described in the literature, and the approaches detailed in the table highlight how seemingly different approaches have similar treatment components. The quotations describing each approach illustrate that the primary and common objective (the practical application) of part of the intervention is based on, and guided by, symptom modification. The proposed rationale for the movement modifier is often based on, or evolved from, biomechanics.

The common objective of these approaches is to identify movements that provoke symptoms and then to introduce a change to that movement. The rationale for the movement modifier, how the movement is explained to the patient, and how that change is delivered may differ across the approaches. All seem to agree, however, that the correct change is the one that eventuates in a reduction in pain and symptoms. Although these models appear to suggest that biomechanics may be partially relevant with respect to symptoms, the guiding rationale for the intervention is symptom modification and symptom control, not the assumed biomechanical correction. A biomechanical explanation, applied post hoc, may be hypothesized when attempting to explain the possible mechanism of the symptom modification.

This is well illustrated in the case series by Ikeda and McGill and contrasted with the cognitive functional therapy approach. Ikeda and McGill identified pain-provocative movements and then made changes (movement modifiers) to the movements, with the intention of reducing pain during measures of muscle activity, kinematics, lumbar joint loads, and joint stability. The authors reported that each participant had different pain-provoking activities and different responses to suggested interventions (i.e., movement modifications). In that case series, a number of movement modifications were attempted, and the "correct" modification was the one that changed symptoms. When identified, the authors then quantified spinal biomechanics during the activity now performed with less pain.

For example, one participant experienced dramatic reductions in pain during a squat when taught to minimize lumbar spine flexion, increase hip flexion, and consciously increase the activation of the latissimus dorsi to create a "bracing" action. The authors reported that this new, less painful movement occurred with decreased lumbar flexion and increased mediolateral shear forces. A second participant experienced pain with a sit-to-stand task. This pain was abolished

# VIEWPOINT

When the participant performed a movement modification consisting of abdominal bracing and attempting to minimize lumbar spine flexion while increasing hip flexion. However, instead of an increase in mediolateral shear (reported in the previous patient), a decrease in mediolateral shear was quantified. Here we have a short-term clinical “success” based on symptoms with different response to mediolateral shear stability. Clinicians can’t measure these biomechanical variables, and the complexity of these cases and what correlates with symptom changes suggest that the biomechanical variable cannot be used to guide the treatment. Rather, it is symptom modification that is important, which is in turn influenced by changing biomechanics. But the correct biomechanical change may only be validated via symptom modification, not via an a priori goal (eg, changing mediolateral shear). Additionally, both successful movement modifications minimized the painful type of movement (spinal flexion). Thus, the correct movement strategy was avoiding the movement that hurt, that is, symptom modification.

Using symptoms as a guide may be illustrated further when the “spine stability” approach is contrasted with the ostensibly different approach of the cognitive functional therapy research group.

Cognitive functional therapy is an approach that aims to address the multidimensional nature of low back pain. Within this approach is a respect for biomechanical contributors to a patient’s pain. Much like the previous “spine stability” approach, a cognitive functional therapy–trained clinician will perform a physical assessment to find painful postures (eg, sleeping, standing) and painful movements (eg, sit-to-stand, squatting, bending forward).

Cognitive functional therapy aims to address the multiple dimensions of pain, and one component of the intervention involves changing the movement behavior associated with pain. Many of the common movement modifications seen within the cognitive functional therapy approach for patients with pain associated with lumbar spine flexion contrast some of the strategies seen in the previously described “spine stability” approach.

|Name|Practical Application|Proposed Rationale|
|---|---|---|
|The Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure17|“The person with shoulder symptoms informs the clinician if an individual procedure: partially or completely alleviates symptoms; has no change on symptoms; or makes symptoms worse”|An aim of the Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure is to assess the response to (1) changing the thoracic kyphosis, (2) changing scapular position, and (3) muscle contraction aiming to influence the glenohumeral joint. The rationale is not to produce a permanent change in posture but to use any positive change as a potential treatment technique, challenging the individual’s previous experience of symptoms|
|Mobilization with movement31|“The technique is indicated if, during its application the technique enables the impaired joint to move freely without pain or impediment”|An aim is to identify positional faults that occur secondary to injury and that lead to maltracking of the joint, resulting in symptoms such as pain, stiffness, or weakness|

During the interview, combined with exposure to feared, avoided, or painful activities while reducing sympathetic responses, abolishing protective and safety behaviors, and normalizing body schema. The biomechanical justifications for both models appear to be vastly contradictory, but if viewed from the perspective of the apparent aim of both approaches, symptom modification, then the appropriate technique is the one that allows the movement to be performed with a reduction in the experience of pain. Thus, the approaches are quite similar in their practical applications, even though their views of ideal joint movement or the proposed mechanism of effect differ substantially. Both approaches may also contribute to improved outcomes by demonstrating to patients that they are able to control their pain, which in turn may influence self-efficacy, locus of control, emotional responses, and the resumption of meaningful and functional activities. Thus, components of the treatment that might appear driven and explained by biomechanics may lead to changes in pain via other contributors to sensitization. Other symptom-modification approaches include mobilization with movement (MWM) and the Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure (SSMP). Similar to cognitive functional therapy and Ikeda and McGill’s case series, a symptomatic movement or activity is identified, and then a modification is made to determine whether the symptoms are reduced during the movement. With MWM, the initial rationale for the treatment was historically based on aberrant joint arthrokinematics "related to minor positional faults that occur secondary to injury and that lead to mal-tracking of the joint, resulting in symptoms such as pain, stiffness, or weakness." It should be noted that while this mechanical explanation has been proposed, proponents of MWM also suggest that other explanations for the possible mechanisms of action include the role of the endocrine, neurophysiological, and neuroimmune systems. In practice, a painful movement is identified, and then a hand or treatment belt provides a force to either the region of the painful joint or a joint remote to the symptoms that has been determined to influence the pain. However, as the aberrant joint arthrokinematics or positional faults cannot be measured or assessed clinically and can only be hypothesized, as such, the changes in symptoms guide the intervention. The SSMP is embedded within a comprehensive management package including advice, education, exercises for the rotator cuff, and, frequently, whole-body rehabilitation. When applying the SSMP, a symptomatic movement is identified, and then the clinician makes various changes in 3 areas (thoracic spine, scapula, glenohumeral region) to determine whether shoulder-related symptoms change. While the initial rationale for those changes may have previously been driven by a potential kinesiological effect, it is the symptom modification that is of primary importance to guide treatment. The SSMP techniques are individual clinical experiments that aim to reduce symptoms. For example, pain may be experienced with shoulder flexion that is abolished with scapular repositioning. It could be hypothesized that this decrease in pain is due to alterations in the subacromial space, altered joint positioning, changes in muscle length-tension relationships, changes in neural tension, or reduced vascular compromise resulting in potentially less mechanical pressure on a sensitized structure. It is acknowledged and clearly stated that the mechanisms underpinning any reduction in symptoms using the SSMP are not known. The intention is not to change posture but to use the change in symptoms as a way of challenging the individual’s beliefs relating to the symptoms (eg, being told a rotator cuff tear will only respond to surgery), and then to use the technique that reduces symptoms in treatment (eg, repeating the previously experienced pain and incorporating the change into functional movements, aiming to disrupt pain memories). Many clinicians will have observed that after repeating this assistance and then slowly removing the assistance, the patient will still continue to have less pain, or the same patient may report reduced symptoms with multiple testing procedures. This may be due to a biomechanical overlap in the different techniques or to a nonbiomechanical effect of the modification procedure. Again, it is the symptom modification that drives the decision making, rather than an “ideal” biomechanical movement. Symptom-modification applications are described in many other approaches. Those treating tendinopathy will often advocate 30 to 45 seconds of isometric loading. This is essentially a symptom modifier to allow a person to function with less pain. Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy uses preferred-direction techniques that are essentially chosen for their ability to modify symptoms. Neurodynamic techniques that involve the movement of neural tissue are often chosen on the basis of finding and changing pain, and running re-education may utilize changes in gait that modify symptoms. Symptom modification is the common thread among many seemingly disparate approaches used in contemporary musculoskeletal practice. Perhaps there is an unnecessary focus on the presumed differences between approaches, similar to the unexplored assumptions that have led to clinical differences in how spinal disorders are treated versus extremity disorders. It is possible that common themes link the SSMP, cognitive functional therapy, the McGill approach, MWM, and other symptom-modifying approaches. A common aim is symptom reduction, which, if achieved, allows the individual to move with less pain. How this is achieved is unknown and may involve myriad multidimensional processes. People move differently when they experience pain, and a reduction

in symptoms may permit changes to the sensitizing. The inability to modify tasks, and, in so doing, “disrupt” the previous memory and association of that task with symptoms.

Modifying symptoms may demonstrate to patients that their pain is reducible or controllable, and may increase movement variability and may also influence the manner in which afferent information is processed. Alternative explanations suggest that moving with less pain results in an expectancy violation that might involve inhibitory learning processes that influence pain and fear. Perhaps most importantly, all of the mentioned approaches appear to reduce symptoms via repeated movements that are then integrated into meaningful and functional activities for the patient.

# Uncertainties With Symptom Modification

Although symptom reduction may be part of a comprehensive approach that addresses the multidimensional nature of pain, there are ongoing challenges and uncertainties associated with this approach.

1. Symptom modifiers are often used as a temporary desensitizer, yet it is unknown how long modifications need to persist to contribute to a meaningful change. There is evidence that movement modifications need to persist for pain or disability to be reduced.
2. Are symptom-modification techniques necessary, and do they confer any additional benefit, or are other components of clinical management sufficient?
3. Symptom reduction should not always be seen as an end in itself, especially if there are additional requirements, such as strength training. However, a reduction in symptoms may then facilitate attainment of other treatment goals and aims.
4. Symptom reduction might not be possible, and attempting symptom change that does not achieve its goal may create hypervigilance or unreasonable patient expectations that ultimately become demotivating and sensitizing. The inability to modify tasks, and, in so doing, “disrupt” the previous memory and association of that task with symptoms.

# Summary

Symptom modification is a commonly used approach in contemporary musculoskeletal practice and was born out of the realization that identifying the structural source of symptoms is generally not possible and that making movement modifications based on kinesiological ideals may be unnecessary and unsupported. The proponents of symptom-modification procedures have proposed seemingly divergent mechanisms to explain the technique. The definitive mechanisms underpinning any reduction in symptoms using these procedures are not clearly understood. Research on the uncertainties associated with this approach is needed to fully understand these commonly used procedures in contemporary clinical practice.

A Time to Reflect on Motor Control in Musculoskeletal Physical Therapy

J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(11):833-836. doi:10.2519/jospt.2018.0614

Motor control is a popular concept within physical therapy and has been broadly described as “an area of practice exploring how the nervous system interacts with the rest of the body and the environment in order to produce purposeful, coordinated movement.” However, the origins of motor control exercises in physical therapy low back pain literature paint a slightly different picture. The field of clinical biomechanics has dominated the low back pain literature since the late 1970s.

During this time, the focus of understanding low back pain was on the structural integrity of the spine with respect to its stability and function, using in vitro models that suggested that the spine was inherently unstable. As a consequence, therapeutic strategies to enhance the stability of the spine and the ability of the spine to adapt under physiologic load emerged as a focus of motor control strategies. These were subsequently applied to other areas of the body.

The purpose of this Viewpoint is to outline the history of motor control and its use in musculoskeletal physical therapy practice and to highlight the consequences of its interpretation and variation in its use. Attention is given to understanding the concept of motor control and its misrepresentation through the use of surrogate terms. A number of comparable definitions are cited in the literature; however, this ambiguity has given rise to surrogate terms, such as neuromuscular control, neuromotor control, and core stability, which may cause confusion in clinical practice, education, and research. How the concept of motor control may be applied in practice to resolve ambiguity and recommendations for the direction of future research are made.

active (muscular) and passive (articu- lar/ligamentous) stabilizers through a control (nervous) system to meet the de- mands of spinal stability, with a distinct lack of theoretical linking between them. This spinal-stability model suggests that causes of symptoms are due to bio- mechanical instability, tissue damage, or structural change and are not in keeping with a contemporary understanding of musculoskeletal practice that values a multidimensional perspective. model23 draws from Anders Bergmark’s22 Panjabi’s2 influential biomechanical theory, which delineated the function of the deep and superficial muscles of the body as being distinctively different and potentially rel- evant in clinical practice. The combina- tion of models contributed to the rise of motor control strategies to theoretically improve painful conditions by isolating movement strategies to target muscles that may contribute to instability. These motor control strategies have been linear- ly described as the rehabilitation strategy to retrain the deep stability muscles, with the vague notion of progressing to larger and more functional movements. This may, in fact, be simply a graded exposure program with respect to load and move- ment within safe environments among a myriad of contextually nonspecific factors. Such approaches lack the cog- nitive, behavioral, emotional, lifestyle, cultural, and contextual understanding that whole-person approaches to health care espouse.22 This is despite greater theoretical and explanatory models su- perseding the biomechanical stability model, such as pain adaptation theory,12 movement variability,19 and development of first-person neuroscience in the con- text of pain.29

# Variation of the Clinical Application of Motor Control in Musculoskeletal Clinical Practice

Many clinical approaches developed from different theoretical models, prem- ises, and measurements have used motor control treatment strategies for musculo- skeletal conditions (TABLE). This raises the following questions: 1. When describing a patient as having “altered” or “poor” motor control, what does that mean and in what context? 2. When therapists describe motor con- trol exercises, what does that mean and when does a movement exercise become a motor control exercise? 3. If motor control exercises constrain aspects of specific movement strate- gies (eg, control), do they run the risk of facilitating poorer outcomes such as fear avoidance?28

# Conceptual Clarification

One way to understand motor control is to examine it at a conceptual level. Concepts have been described as the building blocks of theory and theory de- velopment, and are embedded through our use of language and how we clini- cally practice. Concepts that are vague or not well understood have the poten- tial of creating ambiguity, with unfore- seen consequences that may negatively impact knowledge translation, patient- centered care, clinical education, and, ultimately, patient-related outcomes. It is therefore advantageous that both the development and clarification of con- cepts within the evidence base facilitate a richer understanding and, therefore, ap- plication of them. Ironically, despite the implicit importance of conceptual clarity in fields of research and clinical practice,

The Language of Motor Control: Core Stability—a Source of Confusion and Potential Deleterious Outcome

The surrogate terms of a concept can cause a lack of clarity and confusion if they depart significantly from the concept’s linguistic use and meaning. Neuro-muscular control and neuromotor control contain similar linguistic characteristics in that they refer to the nervous and muscular systems alongside the control of movement. However, the term core stability lacks a clear linguistic relationship with movement. The term core stability emerged through the use of stabilization exercises of the trunk. The use of stabilization exercises in this context has exclusively been identified from within the musculoskeletal literature in the management of low back pain.

McNeill cautioned against using the term core stability, as it was “imprecise and open to interpretation,” and went on to describe core stability as a subset of motor control, suggesting that it required further clarity and perhaps should be abandoned. O’Sullivan is critical of both the terms stabilization and core stability with respect to the management of chronic nonspecific low back pain, stating that the biomedical explanation of lack of stability of the spine may cause “fear, abnormal body focus and reinforcing pain-related movement and avoidance behaviors, hypervigilance, catastrophizing, pain and disability fueling the vicious cycle of pain.” If this were the case with spine-related pain, then it would be reasonable to suggest the same in peripheral joint regions, as discussed eloquently by Jull. Additionally, the relationship between the use of language, a person’s understanding, and subsequent meaning in the literature appears to be very clear.

Perhaps it is of more value to describe the changes in the attribute, or set of attributes, of movement than to suggest that motor control itself changes. This practical approach may improve knowledge translation and resolve ambiguity.

Interpretation From Research Into the Clinic: Lessons Learned?

The research literature has a tendency to measure aspects of the concept of motor control and then to conclude that, if any effect is found, then it is due to the concept itself rather than a change in the attribute. Numerous examples identify attributes of motor control, such as muscle force production, muscle timing, and joint position sense, then identify an outcome after an intervention. The observed outcome is then ambiguously reported as being a change in motor control rather than simply a change in the attribute, such as valgus during a single-leg squat motion or reduced movement variability.

An example is the seminal paper by Hodges and Richardson, which reported that relative delays in the measurements of transversus abdominis muscle contraction occurred in individuals with low back pain when lifting an arm repeatedly. The conclusion of the paper was that this indicated a “deficit of motor control” and that it was “hypothesized to result in inefficient stabilization of the spine.” The unforeseen consequences are that such descriptions are then observed in clinical practice, both conceptually and literally.

Looking back, efforts in clinical practice became more about attempting to feel and retrain the contraction of the deep abdominal muscles, which took precedence over other areas of clinical practice when treating these groups of patients.

The use of the term motor control within practice is often used in a specific way (e.g., knee valgus or hip internal rotation during a step-down task), but is described broadly as a poor motor control strategy; describing the movement strategy rather than the vague term motor control could simply ameliorate this.

Developing New Theoretical Constructs

With developments in cognitive and pain neuroscience and a greater understanding of the complexities involved between pain and rehabilitation, the physical therapy profession may benefit from its continued vigilance against biomedical oversimplifications. The future applications of motor control require a broad and integrated representation of theoretical constructs that outline multiple mechanisms, consequences, and alterations in movement function in relation to the context of pain and suffering, with a fusion of biological, biographical, psychological, social, and cultural paradigms.

Promising theories from cognitive neuroscience may solve some of the challenges of motor control by stepping away from traditional concepts of input, output, feed forward, optimum, and comparator modeling and toward predictive coding under a unifying theory of biological function.

Key Points

- Motor control has enormous potential for developing our understanding of the assessment, treatment, and management of the patients in our care. However, a significant amount of work is required to develop our understanding at the conceptual level to inform further research and implementation in clinical practice.
- Concepts in musculoskeletal practice that are vague run the risk of unresolved ambiguity in language and our collective understanding. The concept of motor control suffers from ambiguity due to its size and scope and may benefit from future analysis and completion of a Delphi study within the context of musculoskeletal physical therapy practice.

Musculoskeletal pain and exercise— challenging existing paradigms and introducing Paul Hendrick, Marcus Bateman, Benjamin E Smith, Sinead Holden, Chris Littlewood, Toby O Smith, Pip Logan

INTRODUCTION

Chronic musculoskeletal pain remains a huge challenge for clinicians and researchers. Exercise interventions are the cornerstone of management for musculoskeletal pain conditions, with the benefits well-established. Exact mechanisms underpinning this effect on musculoskeletal pain are currently unclear. Little is known on the optimal dose and type of exercise, with therapists’ and patients’ behaviour and beliefs around pain during exercise often overlooked in exercise prescription. Exercise-based treatments may be promising, but effect sizes remain small to modest with large variability in exercise prescriptions.

The need for pain to be avoided or alleviated as much as possible has been challenged, with a paradigm shift from traditional biomedical models of pain towards a biopsychosocial model of pain, which is particularly relevant in the context of performing therapeutic exercise.

Indeed, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of painful exercises versus pain-free exercises for chronic musculoskeletal pain that included seven randomised controlled trials found that protocols allowing painful exercises offered a small, but statistically significant, benefit over pain-free exercises short-term. The improvements in patient-reported pain were achieved with a range of contextual factors, such as varying degrees of pain experienced (ranging from pain being allowed to being advised, with/without recommended pain scale) and recovery time (ranging from pain subsiding immediately to within 24 hours). Specifically, we define painful exercises when: exercises are prescribed with instructions for patients to experience pain or where patients are told that it is acceptable and safe to experience pain.

Understanding the potential mechanisms behind the effects of therapeutic exercise, in the context of factors associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain, is key to optimising current exercise prescriptions for managing musculoskeletal pain. The aim of the review is to provide an understanding of the potential mechanisms behind exercise and to build on this into discussing the additional theoretical mechanisms of painful exercises.

This narrative review provides an overview of the current understanding of:

- Musculoskeletal pain in relation to central and peripheral pain mechanisms, the immune system and affective aspects of pain
- The proposed mechanisms behind the potentially additional beneficial effect of allowing painful exercises over pain-free exercises for individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain

# BRIEF BACKGROUND INTO OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF CHRONIC PAIN

Mechanisms of central and peripheral sensitisation

Central sensitisation typically describes an increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) to normal input. With central sensitisation, there are changes in the properties and function of neurons in the CNS, with an increase in pain response relative to the presence and intensity of noxious peripheral stimuli.

In humans and clinical studies, we can measure surrogates which are thought to be reflective of central sensitisation and cover many different underpinning mechanisms. Central sensitisation can be seen as an umbrella term, the main characteristics of which are hyperalgesia, allodynia, temporal summation of pain (TSP), and diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC).

Hyperalgesia is an increased pain response to normally painful stimuli and may be as a result of increased peripheral or central sensitivity. If someone were to experience a pin prick to their knee, they may score the pain one out of 10, for example. However, if they were suffering with chronic knee pain, with hyperalgesia, the same pin prick stimuli would result in a more painful response and a higher pain score being reported.

Allodynia, by contrast, is a pain response to a stimulus that is not normally painful. An example of allodynia is the person who is suffering from chronic low back pain and experiences pain from a light touch to the back.

# Box 1 Summary—Pain Science 2018 in a nutshell.

Traditional pain models that describe tissue pathology as a source of nociceptive input directly linked with pain expression are insufficient for assessing and treating musculoskeletal pain. Other models reconceptualise pain and put forward concepts that are based on the premise that pain does not always provide a measure of the state of tissue pathology. Instead, pain is modulated by many factors, and the relationship between pain and tissue becomes less predictable the longer pain persists. Altered central processing of pain has been shown to be present in many pain conditions, with the immune system playing a role in the development and maintenance of pain sensitisation. Furthermore, unhelpful thoughts of patients and clinicians towards pain, including belief that pain will not get better and that movement will cause further tissue damage and worsening of the pain, are also important issues to remain mindful of.

back pain who complains of pain when they are hugged. A process by which the immune system over activity, as a facilitator of chronic pain and central sensitisation. TSP is a progressive increase in pain perception in the response to repeated stimuli of the same intensity and thought to represent central pain facilitation occurring at the dorsal horn neurons glial activity with individuals with chronic pain. The mechanisms by which glial cell activation leads to synaptic plasticity are not fully understood, but this pathological pain state is thought to correlate with central sensitisation, with a large overlap of contributing mechanisms.

HOW MIGHT ALLOWING PAINFUL EXERCISE MITIGATE PAIN? THREE MECHANISMS THAT ARISE FROM RECENT NEUROSCIENCE DISCOVERIES

Traditional explanations by which exercise improves pain and disability in chronic musculoskeletal pain rely on its effect on biomechanics and corresponding changes in loading of the musculoskeletal system. This model of clinical reasoning, whereby pain improves as a result of biomechanics, fails to take into account the full biopsychosocial spectrum of factors. This may be the reason why there is a lack of evidence supporting any specific exercise intervention. It may be that factors common to all exercises have the greatest mediating effect on pain and disability. The following section will discuss the mechanisms associated with exercise and central pain processes, the immune system and affective aspects of pain, including a theoretical rationale for the potential additional benefit of allowing painful therapeutic exercise, over and above pain free exercises alone.

Affective aspects of pain—reconceptualisation of pain-related fear Some patients report fear of doing further tissue damage if an activity or exercise is painful. A major consideration of the beneficial effects of painful exercise is the potential associated learning involved. Painful exercises have the potential to help reconceptualise pain-related fear, that is, patients may be challenged to think differently about pain and tissue damage, and allowing painful exercises offers an opportunity for patients to reintroduce movement that were previously perceived as a threat. The amygdala is often referred to as the fear centre of the brain and plays a key role in shaping our response to fear, particularly our response to pain-related memories and fear. The cingulate cortex also plays a role in our response.

The role of the immune system It is thought the immune system plays an important role in chronic pain states, including the development of long-term hyperalgesia and allodynia. The innate immune response of inflammation is activated by various processes, including exposure to microbial cell wall fragments, toxins, irritant chemicals and autoimmune reactions. Typically, these are detected by a family of pattern-recognition receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs) that regulate the CNS’s innate immune response. TLRs are predominantly made up of glial cells and sense the presence of damage or danger originating both endogenously and exogenously, translating this into central immune signals that can be interpreted by the CNS.

DNIC can be assessed in humans through the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) response (also known as ‘pain inhibits pain’). During CPM, the descending pain inhibitory responses are challenged during a painful conditioning stimulus. This is used as a proxy of the overall effectiveness of the endogenous analgesic system, likely occurring through both the opioid and non-opioid pathways. An example of CPM in action is when one might report lower pain scores for a primary complaint, say low back pain, in the presence of a secondary painful stimulus, for instance placing the hand in ice cold water.

The role of exercises in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Therapeutic exercise challenges the threat response to pain. Central pain processes, the immune system and affective aspects of pain may respond differently when pain is conceptualised as non-threatening. Adapted from Physiotherapy, 84(1), Gifford, Louis., ‘Pain, the tissues and the nervous system: a conceptual model’, 27–36, Copyright (1998), with permission from Elsevier.

Activity avoidance precedes the development of pain, with pain causing the behavioural changes. However, research has demonstrated that even mental preparation for such movements and activities can trigger the fear-memory centre of the brain, thought to be an overactive threat protective mechanism, triggering pain, even in the clear absence of nociception.

This is an important finding, as it links with other work that has demonstrated that an individual's beliefs and attitude to pain, and what constitutes 'threatening' pain or not, leads to altered movement behaviour in those that perceive a stimulus as threatening.

By allowing painful exercises, with appropriate 'safety-cues', new inhibitory associations may be made; these new inhibitory associations theoretically may compete with the original conditioned response, so that it becomes suppressed.

Safety-cues may include statements such as: 'your shoulder is painful because it has become deconditioned and not used to movement. We need to exercise your shoulder, so it will become strong and conditioned to enable you to do what you need to do'.

Research supporting the studies that have reported involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the learning of new inhibitory associations, which has direct projections onto the amygdala.

For instance, the mPFC might have a role in the storing of long-term extinction memories that block and suppress the amygdala. Human studies interventions for musculoskeletal pain. The potential mechanisms behind the painful exercises are thought to be that painful exercises may alter both the response-outcome and efficacy expectation, both components of self-efficacy.

Within the context of the theory presented, the hierarchy construction of painful exercises, from easier to more difficult/higher load, could improve one's response-outcome expectation, where the patient begins to expect that they can tolerate harder exercises, without triggering the previous experience of pain-related fear and pain flare-ups.

|Treatment goal|Example|
|---|---|
|Understand what the patient understands|Why do you think you have pain?|
|Challenge unhelpful beliefs|Is it safe for you to exercise? Why? Discuss with the patient. Prescribe exercises or movements that were previously avoided/or painful. New inhibitory associations may be made with painful exercises.|
|Enhance self-efficacy|Are you confident of completing this exercise? What do you think will happen? Discuss with the patient. The hierarchy construction of painful exercises, from easier to more difficult may improve self-efficacy.|
|Provide safety-cues|Your knee is painful because it has become deconditioned and not used to movement. Pain is not a sign of tissue damage. We need to exercise your knee, so it will become strong and conditioned to enable you to do what you need to do.|
|Provide advice on suitable levels of pain|If you’re coping with the level of pain, then continue with the exercise. If the pain is more than you find acceptable or flares up longer than 24 hours after the exercise, then decrease the amount of exercise until you’re coping with it again.|
|Provide advice on exercise modification|It is important to adjust the exercises dependent on your symptoms. This may mean increasing the number of repetitions that you do or the amount of resistance that you use as it becomes easier; or decreasing if it gets too painful. Try not to avoid doing the exercises altogether as complete rest is unlikely to solve the problem. Instead reduce the exercises to a level that is acceptable.|

Phenomenon is termed exercise-induced lower activation of the DNIC and higher pain ratings. The network of subcortical structures associated with reducing fear-avoidance, with reconceptualisation of pain-related fear, could reduce the threat perception and thus the activity of the amygdala and somatosensory cortex. The result of which could be positive modulation of the sympathetic nervous system over and above the usual effect of physical activity, and a greater reduction in the cascade of the physiological immune response and the inflammatory system.

Evidence for the analgesic effect of exercise comes from experimental studies that attenuate pain sensitivity, as measured by pressure summation. A number of different exercise interventions have been investigated, including cardiovascular exercise (running and cycling) and resistance exercise, including isometric and dynamic resistance. It is thought the endogenous opioid system is triggered by exercise-induced activation of arterial baroreceptors following increases in heart rate and blood pressure, with an associated dose response.

Exercise can trigger the release of β-endorphins from the pituitary and hypothalamus, in turn activating μ-opioid receptors peripherally and centrally, triggering the endogenous opioid system. The hypothalamus projects onto the periaqueductal grey (PAG) resulting in further endogenous analgesic effects via the descending nociceptive inhibitory mechanisms.

A recent systematic review concluded that painful exercises typically have higher loads and dose of exercise and a theoretical reason painful exercises may have a greater affect than pain free exercises could be a greater EIH.

Another theoretical reason painful exercises may work to reduce pain is through the CPM response. As previously explained, during CPM the descending pain inhibitory responses are challenged during a painful conditioning stimulus. Several studies have demonstrated that pain-related fear negatively disrupts the endogenous pain inhibitory systems via the process of CPM.

It is well understood that regular general exercise reduces the risk of developing age-related illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. However, regular general exercise also reduces susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections, suggesting that there are mechanisms at play that improves the overall immune function.

Looking specifically at allowing painful exercises, it is known that the amygdala projects onto areas of the brain that play key roles in the sympathetic response to threat, such as the locus coeruleus and pons, with inflammation being directly activated by the sympathetic nervous system response.

Central pain processes, the immune system and affective aspects of pain appear to respond to exercise in a positive way. There might be some additional advantages when the exercise is painful, over and above pain-free. These overlapping mechanisms may mitigate and moderate.

musculoskeletal pain, and through the delivery of exercises that reconceptualise pain as safe and non-threatening, facilitated by appropriate clinical support and education (figure 1). Allowing painful exercises may result in greater loads/volume of exercise, but does challenge traditional prescription based solely on strength and conditioning principles with a tissue-focused approach.

# CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS

This review has presented a contemporary understanding of musculoskeletal pain towards a potential rationale for the mechanisms behind any additional benefit of allowing painful exercises, over pain-free exercises, in the management of musculoskeletal disease. This additional mechanistic consideration could be used to help clinicians in the prescription of therapeutic exercise (table 1) and for researchers to advance knowledge for such a globally problematic condition.

Background

Pain is no longer considered to be simply the transmission of nociception. Current conceptions suggest pain is the most salient part of an activated body protection system; an output subsequent to the complex interaction of homeostatic systems in response to an identified threat (Fig. 1) (Jänig et al., 2006). The body protection system involves motor, autonomic, psychological, endocrine and immune systems, and pain emerges from the activation of a specific neurological network, matrix or signature (Gifford, 1998; Melzack, 2005; Moseley et al., 2012; Melzack and Katz, 2013). Pain perception takes place in a context of an individual’s environment, including the physical, social and emotional contexts (Siddall and Cousins, 2004; Gatchel et al., 2007; Malenbaum et al., 2008), and then is managed in a clinical context influenced by the values and beliefs of the therapist (Foster et al., 2010; Nijs et al., 2012). Clinical reasoning requires that manual therapists integrate the multiple dimensions of pain to account for this variation and formulate effective treatment.

The Pain and Movement Reasoning Model presented in this paper attempts to capture the complexity of the human pain experience. The Model is strongly underpinned by Neuromatrix Theory and incorporates current concepts of neuroplastic determinants on the quality and nature of pain (Woolf, 2011; Moseley and Flor, 2012; Melzack and Katz, 2013). Consequently, the Model avoids the risk of simplifying elements of the pain experience into linear independent systems e.g. central sensitisation, neuropathic, nociceptive. In a similar way the Model does not separate the bio-psycho-social framework into its component parts, but instead integrates the combined influence of the physiological, cognitive, emotional and social inputs on neurophysiological mechanisms. Through consideration of this range of information, the predominant and changeable influences can be identified, leading therapists to select the most appropriate techniques.

The integration of information is facilitated by the triangular structure of the Model coordinated by the three categories located at the apices of the triangle e central modulation, regional influences and local stimulation (Fig. 2). By placing a grid in the centre

In the clinical setting what is occurring within symptomatic tissue does not always relate to the pain expressed.

Therapists are encouraged to consider three subcategories to estimate the potential for central modulation; (1) predisposing factors, (2) prolonged afferent input and (3) cognitive-emotional-social state (Fig. 3).

# 2.1. Predisposing factors

The first subcategory recognises that prior experiences including trauma, illness and disease preset the state and structure of the nervous system. These factors may determine the baseline sensitivity of the person’s nervous system to which new episodes of perceived vulnerability and threat are overlayed. Where a person has a pre-existing illness it is likely the body protection systems are activated. For example, persistent inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory arthropathies and autoimmune diseases, can be expected to create pain sensitivity (Lee et al., 2009) through persistent chemically-generated nociception and altered immune function. Similarly, activity of the inflammatory glial cells within the CNS is increasingly seen as an important component of the pain experience (Thacker et al., 2007; Schmid et al., 2013).

People who have experienced trauma or torture have been shown to have an enhanced pain response (Linton, 2002; Granot et al., 2011; Fleischman et al., 2014; Williams and van der Merwe, 2013). This could be due to reduced central inhibition, especially where there is ongoing distress and perceived vulnerability and

# 2. Central Modulation Category

As humans appraise their personal situation, pain perception occurs within a framework of ongoing simultaneous processing at different levels of consciousness (Moseley et al., 2012; van Ryckeghem et al., 2012; Bulcke et al., 2013). For therapists, this translates into the requirement of managing a person holistically where context is important. To do this requires an understanding that the sensory component of pain, nociception, always occurs within the broader setting of an individual’s situation (Weisse, 2004; Wiech et al., 2008; Wiech and Tracey, 2013) and their psycho-neuro-immunological state (Watkins and Maier, 2000; Austin and Moalem-Taylor, 2010).

The category ‘Central Modulation’ is representative of the factors that have been shown to influence pain through changes to higher centre processing, reducing central descending inhibitory influences, or by increasing efficacy of spinal synapses (Woolf, 2011; Smart et al., 2012a). The overall assumption is that modification of pain via these factors can be attributed to changes in nervous system function, and in persistent cases to structure, i.e. due to neuroplasticity. The resultant change in sensitivity can contribute to an enhanced pain response (i.e. sensitisation) or a diminished pain response (i.e. inhibition), depending on the nature and context of the influence (Wiech and Tracey, 2009; Ploner et al., 2011; Melzack and Katz, 2013). All experiences are processed in the psycho-neuro-immunological systems of a person, which is why

threat (Linton and Shaw, 2011), but also could be due to enhanced efficacy of nociceptive transmission (Woolf, 2011). The genetics of pain also needs to be considered. A person may be born with a predisposition for pain (Nielsen et al., 2008; Mogil, 2012). More commonly, previous nervous system experiences can modify phenotypes expression through genetic transcription, enhancing neural transmission (Woolf, 2011; Hush et al., 2013). As a result conditions such as persistent neck and back pain, tension-type headache, orofacial pain, irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia frequently coexist (Woolf, 2011). Gene expression also contributes to the large variation of response to analgesic medications (Diatchenko et al., 2011).

# 2.2. Prolonged afferent input

It is well established that prolonged noxious stimulation leading to ongoing afferent activity can enhance synaptic transmission (Woolf, 2011) and this subcategory directs therapists to consider evidence of this in the patient’s history. Persistent pain leads to changes in the spinal cord and higher centres, not only in processing of pain-related inputs, but also in the outputs seen in an individual’s psychological state, and their immune, endocrine and motor systems (Siddall and Cousins, 2004). In various persistent pain states, imaging suggests neural organisational changes and degeneration (Apkarian et al., 2004; Wand et al., 2011). In the spinal cord there are chemical changes affecting signal transmission, processing and genetic transcription. This leads to inhibitory inter-neurone loss, sprouting of cells between laminae, sustained activation of descending facilitatory circuits and dysfunction of descending inhibition paths (Gifford and Butler, 1997; Siddall and Cousins, 2004; Winkelstein, 2004; Tracey and Mantyh, 2007). Such neural changes can result in the spreading of symptoms and an enhanced response to both noxious and non-noxious stimuli (Woolf, 2011; Schmid et al., 2013). The modifying capabilities of prolonged stimulation at both the spinal cord and cortical levels demonstrate activity-dependent neuroplasticity. This process needs to be incorporated into reasoning and challenges the labelling of pain as acute or chronic. Clearly, time alone is not responsible for these higher centre changes seen in imaging studies for those with persistent pain. Recognising the transformation from an acute to an ongoing pain state as a transitory neuroplastic process affecting certain individuals, and valuing the inter-relatedness of certain psycho-social factors, would seem more appropriate.

# 2.3. Cognitive-emotional-social

Psychological and social factors are regarded as important for predicting long term pain-related disability (Watson and Kendall, 2000; Hill and Fritz, 2011; Linton and Shaw, 2011; Nicholas et al., 2011). Their role in determining or modulating the individual’s pain experience, as postulated in Neuromatrix Theory, is now well established (Carter et al., 2002; Campbell and Edwards, 2009; Main and George, 2011; van Ryckeghem et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2013; Ruscheweyh et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2013). Psychosocial factors are important in the clinical presentations of people with ongoing pain states but also of people with a recent onset of pain. Relevant psycho-social influences on pain include: levels of anxiety; fear, and the accompanying avoidant behaviour related to pain, functional changes, and fear itself; depression; anger; self-efficacy; catastrophising; acceptance; attention; coping strategies; social support; fatigue and work circumstances (Hill and Fritz, 2011; Linton and Shaw, 2011; Schuh-Hofer et al., 2013). These relationships with pain have been identified in both recent-onset and persistent low back pain, whiplash, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and other complex pain states (Giardino et al., 2003; Bradley et al., 2004; Gatchel et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009; Somers et al., 2009; Arendt-Nielsen et al., 2010). Imaging studies have demonstrated the relevance of psycho-social influences on higher- centre processing of pain (Loggia et al., 2008; Wiech et al., 2008; Tracey, 2010; Villemure and Schweinhardt, 2010; Simons et al., 2014). Notably, studies suggest pain and social distress or rejection activate similar parts of the brain, raising the possibility that people who are socially unsupported or disadvantaged may be predisposed to pain (Eisenberger, 2012; Meerwijk et al., 2012). This reflects the initial premise that pain is the most salient expression of a centrally evoked body protection response.

# 2.4. The importance of the Central Modulation Category

All presentations of pain will have an element of central sensitisation or inhibition that needs to be incorporated into the reasoning process. While it has been convention to regard ‘acute’ and ‘chronic’ pain as different, this model regards all ‘types’ of pain as one, and acknowledges the capacity of the central nervous system for plasticity. The variation in presentation can largely be explained by the state and structure of the nervous system; that is, how sensitive it is. Common conceptions of acute pain assume a naive nervous system or at least an unsensitised one that has no experience in processing previous pain and threatening situations. Accordingly, if attributions of central sensitisation are reserved for chronic presentations, the clinical reasoning of acute presentations becomes simplistic, risking poor decision making with regard to treatment. For example, a person who is anxious about the seriousness of their acute injury will likely have reduced central inhibitory influences, modulated through attentional and emotional synaptic networks, leading to a sensitised state of the nervous system (Villemure and Schweinhardt, 2010). The therapist needs to incorporate knowledge of this enhanced pain state into any clinical reasoning process, especially in response to the person’s pain report. Failure to address anxiety or distress in acute presentations risks a poorer outcome for the person (Hill and Fritz, 2011; Nicholas et al., 2011). Consideration of the Central Modulation Category provides an understanding of the potential influences on central processing including the impact of learning and memory abilities (Flor, 2012; Zusman, 2012). The estimation of a significant contribution from factors known to modulate the sensitivity of the nervous system may lead the therapist to explore psycho-neuro-immunological retraining approaches including education, stress management, cognitive reframing, body awareness, graded motor imagery and graded exposure (Flor, 2012; Moseley and Flor, 2012).

# 3. Regional Influences category

The ‘Regional Influences’ category reflects biomechanical principles and neurological influences on pain that suggest dysfunction remote to the site of reported pain (Smart et al., 2012b; Schmid et al., 2013). The sub-categories identified include ‘Kinetic Chain’, ‘Patho-neuro-dynamics’ and ‘Convergence’ (Fig. 4).

# 3.1. Kinetic chain

Biomechanically-related issues such as proprioception, hypermobility and hypo-mobility are represented by the ‘Kinetic chain’ sub-category. The assumption is that when elements of the ‘chain’ are not providing normal support, or alternatively flexibility, then movement along the ‘chain’ is adversely affected (Slipman et al., 2000b; Winkelstein, 2004; Eygendaal et al., 2007; Johnston et al.,

Nerves are considered to be vulnerable when passing through tunnels, when branching, and when passing through fascia or adjacent to bony surfaces (Walsh, 2005). As a result there exist a variety of interfacing places where nerve root and peripheral nerve PND is implicated in various disorders of both upper and lower quadrants (Pratt, 2005; Nee and Butler, 2006).

# Convergence

|Convergence|SomatoSomatic|Regional Influences|Local Stimulation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Viscero .Somatic|Influences| | |
|Kinetic Chain| |Patho-neuro-dynamics| |
| | |Hypermobility|Weakness|
| | |Hypomobility|Paraesthesia|
| | |Proprioception|Reflexes|
| | |Neural Connective tissue bed interfaces| |

Convergence relates to the so-called 'referral of symptoms' based upon shared neural structures and mis-location of the tissue source i.e. attributed to an area without nociceptor activity. Lumbar spine research has demonstrated referral to the back, pelvic and leg regions can occur, in the absence of peripheral nerve dysfunction, when various different tissues are stimulated. This includes the intervertebral discs, muscles, zygapophysial joints, sacroiliac joints, tendons, ligaments and periosteum (Slipman et al., 2000a; Cornwall et al., 2006; van der Wurff et al., 2006; Graven-Nielsen and Arendt-Nielsen, 2010). The referral patterns of different tissues are difficult to distinguish. It has become evident that using symptomatic presentations and clinical signs alone, it is very difficult to distinguish pain arising for example from an intervetebral disc or zygapophysial joint (Schwarzer et al., 1994, 1995; O’Neill et al., 2002; DePalma, 2012; Bogduk et al., 2013).

The importance of the Regional Influences category

Subjective reports of distant yet related symptoms, biomechanical insufficiencies in adjacent tissue, associated paraesthesia, or changes in objective neurological signs and PND tests will suggest there are regional factors to be addressed.

# Pathoeneuroedynamics (PND)

PND can be defined as when a stimulus of a position or movement exceeds the capability of a compromised nerve bed (Nee and Butler, 2006). For example if a nerve bed has altered functioning and accompanying inability to slide in relation to adjacent tissue, movement that may normally be benign, leads to transmission of nociceptive information along the nerve bed, and the pain may be perceived as arising from a different body part. Such compressive or entrapment neuropathic results in inflammatory changes, which produce altered functioning at the free end of the nociceptor, along the length of the nerve, at cell bodies and in addition leads to changes within the CNS (Nee and Butler, 2006; Zusman, 2009; Schmid et al., 2013).

Literature suggests it is movement of sensitised neural connective tissue that is involved in this response (Coppieters et al., 2005, 2006; Nee et al., 2012; Schmid et al., 2012). However it has also been considered that stretching of compromised blood vessels, lymphatics, fascia or other multi-segmental tissue may produce a similar effect of pain arising from limited movement of distant body parts (Wilson, 1994; Kelley and Jull, 1998; Walsh, 2005).

# Assessing the movement patterns and neural integrity of distal

parts will highlight where connective tissue, joints or muscles are altered. These altered tissues become the targets for manual treatments or exercises. Alleviating regional influences will allow for the clearer identification of any matters occurring local to the site of symptoms.

# Local stimulation category

The third category, local stimulation, further emphasises a pain mechanisms approach by identifying the nociceptive triggers that might occur within damaged or diseased tissue, or indeed healthy tissue being loaded in a manner which threatens damage (Fig. 5) (Gifford and Butler, 1997; Smart et al., 2012c). Of course, nociception, like central sensitisation, is not pain.

# Chemical stimulation

It can be expected that when manual therapists are faced with predominantly nociceptive presentations in the clinical setting, they will be dealing with the chemical sequalae associated with tissue damage. By the time the injured person arrives at a clinic, tissues are generally not still being subjected to supra-threshold mechanical stressors e.g. the stressors sustained by a ligament at time of injury are no longer at play. The chemical nociceptive contribution to pain can be explained by the increased concentration of inflammatory substances (sometimes called the ‘sensitising soup’) stimulating free nerve endings of nociceptors and lowering thresholds of activation (Siddall and Cousins, 1997; Schmelz et al., 2003; Bove, 2008; Richards and McMahon, 2013). This peripheral sensitisation is most useful, as the resultant tenderness promotes protection of vulnerable injured tissue and is utilised by therapists to identify the potential location of superficial tissue pathology with reasonable accuracy. Evidence of inflammation and tissue disease or damage can help with estimations of the contribution of local stimulation to the person’s pain experience (Smart et al., 2012c). However, it is important the therapist is making judgments based on the prevailing pain mechanisms i.e. prevalence of sensitising chemicals, not simply that tissue damage equals pain.

# Mechanical deformation

Mechanical nociceptors will respond to above-threshold distortion or derangement of tissues (Gifford and Butler, 1997; Smart et al., 2012c). Mostly, by the time the person presents at the clinic a guarding and protective posture means the original mechanical trigger - a supra-threshold distortion of tissue - is no longer relevant. The affected body part is postured for safety and protection but other mechanical stimuli may still be contributing to a person’s pain report. The distortion of tissue - distraction and compression - caused by swelling or subluxation or altered mechanics, may still be adequate to trigger mechanical nociceptors, especially if these have been sensitised by the inflammation process. The painful movements often experienced with tissue changes are likely to be better explained as due to chemically-triggered sensitising mechanisms, not the mechanically-triggered danger signals indicative of potential tissue damage (Littlewood et al., 2013; Richards and McMahon, 2013).

# The importance of the local stimulation category

Identifying this category as the predominant mechanism to address in treatment will be based on assessment findings that infer nociceptors are being triggered by chemical or mechanical stimulation, or peripheral sensitisation is influencing the transmission of danger messages. This may also include finding pain responses that are predictable to specific postural and/or movement patterns, and especially when occurring in the absence of symptoms and signs indicative of neurogenic involvement, CNS sensitisation or PND (Smart et al., 2012c).

# Example of application of the model

Pain-provoking gleno-humeral movement provides a good example of how the Model could be applied. Central processes, such as the enhancement of signals at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and reduced central inhibitory processes due to the perception of tissue vulnerability (i.e. central modulation), influence the pain output. Causal behaviours may include abnormal scapula-thoracic movement or posture, in parallel with regional pathoeneurodynamics (i.e. regional influences). Another mechanism is likely to be altered pH triggering chemical nociceptors (i.e. local stimulation). Valuing these multiple contributors directs treatment to where the greater proportion of pain is arising from, and offers an increased number of management approaches. This reasoning can ensure a more comprehensive approach to addressing pain.

CLINICAL COMMENTARY

# Unraveling the Mechanisms of Manual Therapy: Modeling an Approach

Manual therapy (MT) interventions are a preferred treatment for health care professionals from a variety of disciplines and patients with musculoskeletal pain conditions. Despite the popularity of MT, systematic reviews only find small to modest effect sizes or fail to recommend these interventions.

In fact, individual clinical practice guidelines for low back pain include differing recommendations for the use of spinal manipulation, indicating Mechanistic-based approaches conflicting research support. Such to treating individuals presenting findings are not dissimilar to those for with musculoskeletal pain conditions other interventions for pain and are represent a rational targeted approach attributed to substantial individual for personalizing treatment variability in treatment response. There are 2 prerequisites needed to Subsequently, the clinical decision-making process that guides the use of MT may be best directed at the individual patient on the provider level, rather than using a “one-size-fits-all” approach.

SYNOPSIS: Manual therapy interventions are popular among individual health care providers and their patients; however, systematic reviews do not strongly support their effectiveness. Small treatment effect sizes of manual therapy interventions may result from a “one-size-fits-all” approach to treatment. Mechanistic-based treatment approaches to manual therapy offer an intriguing alternative for identifying patients likely to respond to manual therapy. However, the current lack of knowledge of the mechanisms through which manual therapy interventions inhibit pain limits such an approach. The nature of manual therapy interventions further confounds such an approach, as the related mechanisms are likely a complex interaction of factors related to the intervention, the patient, the provider, and the environment in which the intervention is provided.

When these 2 prerequisites are met, patients can be matched to an appropriate treatment, allowing for the targeted application of a specific intervention of known mechanisms to patients with presentations amenable to these mechanisms. Mechanistic-based treatment approaches for MT necessitate identification of the key mechanisms through which MT works; however, the current understanding of these mechanisms is lacking, requiring additional and more optimally designed studies to answer this important question.

# The Need for a Model of the Mechanisms of MT

The mechanistic approach to MT is complicated by the complex nature of MT interventions. While drug effects are often attributed to a specific and well-defined active ingredient, the mechanisms underlying complex interventions, such as those used for MT, are multifaceted and comprise specific and nonspecific factors related to the intervention, the patient, the provider, and the environment in which the intervention is provided. Subsequently, a single, well-defined mechanism of an MT intervention is unlikely, and resulting outcomes are probably related to varying inherent elements and contextual factors. We believe that research focusing on individual mechanisms in isolation will always fall short of providing meaningful insight, because MT is a complex intervention involving

multiple interactions of complementary mechanisms. As with other complex interventions, MT providers and researchers benefit from a theoretical model to both guide the design and assist in interpreting the results of mechanistic studies.

We published a model to begin to account for the multiple pain inhibitory mechanisms of MT. The model postulates that the mechanical stimulus from an MT intervention results in neurophysiological responses within the peripheral and central nervous systems responsible for pain inhibition (FIGURE 1). Importantly, the model is applicable to different MT approaches (ie, joint mobilization, massage, neurodynamic interventions) and not intended to emphasize any tic literature within the context of our single or specific approach. The model was designed to comprehensively account for the interacting mechanisms behind a complex MT intervention. Importantly, the model allows researchers (1) to consider and account for competing mechanisms when designing studies (ie, mechanisms related to biomechanical effects, peripherally mediated effects, spinal cord–mediated effects, and supraspinally mediated effects), and (2) to acknowledge the potential for alternative plausible explanations to their findings should the study not account for competing mechanisms.

This clinical commentary will address the current state of the MT mechanistic studies, which, unlike animal models, prohibit direct observation of the

# nervous system. Our model based the assessment of nervous system responses to MT in humans on associated responses serving as behavioral correlates (ie, proxy measures) of underlying mechanisms.

For example, changes in skin blood flow represent an indirect correlate of the sympathetic nervous system responses to MT, while changes in the flexor withdrawal reflex may represent a spinal cord–mediated response to MT. Numerous studies have provided evidence of immediate neurophysiological responses following MT; however, while serving as proof-of-concept work for more complex designs, single pre/post randomized controlled trials are not designed to determine the individual or combined influential factors of clinical improvement. Future studies must establish a link between these associated responses and clinical symptoms, as well as establish covariance of improvements between associated responses and clinical outcomes. Evaluating these multifactorial relationships requires complex study designs that are not always feasible to conduct in clinical settings. Cook18 has highlighted the limitations of reliance on immediate assessment of either mechanistic or clinical outcomes, including similar findings in response to numerous interventions and the failure to relate these to long-term clinical outcomes. One strategy to address these concerns and to advance this line of research in future studies is to attempt to distinguish these immediate associated responses as treatment mediators and moderators. Mediators are variables measured during the course of treatment to evaluate for change and subsequent impact on outcome. Mediators have been described as process variables that implicate possible mechanisms by which an intervention may be effective, especially when these variables represent a plausible construct that the treatment is intended to modify. Potential mediators of change establish how or why treatment effects occur and should be identified a priori and measured before, during, and after treatment to establish.

# Advancing the Understanding of the Mechanical Force

Clinical use of MT is traditionally driven by the assumption of a peripherally acting, mechanical mechanism, for example, the application of a specific MT technique applied to a perceived dysfunctional vertebral segment identified through passive movement assessment or imaging. Our model acknowledges a mechanical force as an inherent element of any MT intervention and directs studies to account for mechanical force as a potential contributing mechanism. Based on the literature at the time, the model theorized that clinical outcomes were related to corresponding neurophysiological responses and occurred independent of the specific mechanical parameters of the force. Little has changed to support a mechanism related to the specific biomechanical parameters of the interventions.

# Advancing the Understanding of MT-Related Pain Inhibition

Our model was designed to account for the mechanism of MT on pain inhibition. Psychophysical testing, such as the application of standardized noxious thermal or mechanical forces, allows for the study of mechanisms related to changes in pain processing. Systematic reviews support a transient pain inhibitory effect of MT on psychophysical measures, occurring both locally and remotely. Higher pain sensitivity, as determined by a lower pain threshold at the site of injury or pain, may reflect local sensitization in the peripheral (reduced receptor threshold) or central nervous system (specific somatosensory).

regions), while higher pain sensitivity at shown that temporal summation of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation has incorporated paradigms that determine differential pain-relieving effects on movement-evoked pain. Movement-evoked pain lessens following an MT intervention, which suggests that future investigation should differentiate these findings from spontaneous pain, in terms of the magnitude of response as well as the relationship to clinical outcomes of importance to patients.

Advancing the Understanding of Supraspinally Mediated Mechanisms

Previous mechanistic models of MT incorporating nervous system responses took a “reflexive” route, meaning that neurological responses to MT were limited to physiologic or autonomic outputs. Our model acknowledged such processes but advanced the pathway into regions of the nervous system not typically considered as having a “direct” response to MT. The timing of this focus was vital, because when the model was first proposed, limited evidence from human and animal research supported the assumption of MT altering sensory processing in supraspinal structures.

The understanding of supraspinally mediated mechanisms of MT has progressed greatly since the model was originally published, including studies of MT-associated measures of cortical function through somatosensory-evoked potentials, as well as neuroimaging advances through positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Findings from these approaches have significantly advanced the understanding of MT-related changes in cortical function. For example, fMRI has been used to study the effects of MT in several complementary ways. First, fMRI has been used to investigate cortical responses during MT. For example, during the posterior-to-anterior mechanical force produced by MT, activation is observed in medial parts of the postcentral gyrus (S1) bilaterally, the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), posterior parts of the insular cortex, different

parts of the cingulate cortex, and the cerebellum. Second, fMRI has been used to assess how MT alters the central nervous system responses to a noxious stimulus. For example, healthy volunteers underwent fMRI scanning while receiving noxious stimuli applied to the cuticle of the index finger. Participants then received a supine thrust manipulation directed to the mid thoracic spine and were immediately returned to the scanner for reimaging with a second delivery of noxious stimuli. The thrust joint manipulation was associated with hypoalgesia, as well as a significant reduction in activity in the sensory-motor cortices S1, S2, anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum, and insular cortices, with reduction of cortical activity correlated to decreased pain perception. Third, resting-state fMRI assessed the coupling of cortical activity between brain regions involved in the processing of nociception before and after MT. Healthy volunteers, who completed an exercise-injury protocol to induce low back pain, underwent resting-state fMRI. They were then randomized into 1 of 3 MT interventions: spinal thrust manipulation, spinal nonthrust mobilization, or therapeutic touch, and then underwent a second resting-state fMRI. Following MT, there was a reduction in experimentally induced low back pain, with no differences observed between types of MT. Common to all MT interventions, the coupling of cortical activity decreased between sensory discriminant and affective regions (primary somatosensory cortex and posterior insular cortex), while increases were observed between affective regions (posterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices) and affective and descending pain modulatory regions (insular cortex and periaqueductal gray). The results of this study suggest that MT alters cortical interactions within nociceptive processing networks at rest, such that subsequent stimuli are received within the cortex in an altered state. Future studies should attempt to further clarify how MT disrupts maladaptive cortical patterns and functional connectivity associated with chronic pain.

Limitations Methodological approaches to measurement are one of the primary limitations to the study of MT mechanisms, as many techniques described in the model to evaluate nervous system processing are not direct or are isolated measures of nervous system activity. The model is based on associated neurophysiological responses and not direct observation of nervous system activity. Subsequently,

have been associated with clinical outcomes. For example, a study comparing the use of spinal thrust manipulation to nonthrust mobilization for participants with low back pain observed no group-dependent differences in pain, disability, total visits, days in care, or rate of recovery; however, a significant association was observed between the treating therapist’s lack of equipoise (ie, preference for thrust versus nonthrust mobilization) and subsequent outcomes.19 Moreover, provider expectations can also influence patient outcomes. For example, baseline physician expectations are predictive of changes in pain and physical function in response to acupuncture in individuals with chronic pain99 and in return to work following an acute episode of low back pain.58 Furthermore, pain relief in response to a placebo intervention was significantly greater for a group of individuals following third molar surgery when the provider was aware of the chance of administering an active medication, as compared to when the provider knew that no active drug would be administered.44 Collectively, provider preference and expectations have strong potential to influence MT outcomes; therefore, we have revised the model to account for both the potential role of provider characteristics in the mechanical force, as well as the potential influence on patient-reported outcomes through a supraspinally mediated effect.

the observed responses are suggestive of specific nervous system activity (generally based on findings from animal studies); however, these assumptions are not directly confirmable in humans, as conducting such studies would introduce valid ethical concerns. The model considers associated neurophysiological responses and attempts to provide direct relationships to clinical outcomes. Importantly, neurophysiological responses to MT are beneficial in furthering our understanding of why MT is effective; however, the gold standard for determining whether MT is effective is patient self-report.80 The model can be used to guide and account for nervous system responses to MT as a plausible explanation for observed clinical outcomes; however, neurophysiological responses must be linked to patient self-report outcomes and should not be interpreted as a replacement for determining clinically effective interventions.

Advancing the Model

We have modified the model since its initial development to represent some of the key changes in understanding MT mechanisms. For simplicity, we present the revised model in its entirety (FIGURE 2) and by individual zones, with zone 1 (FIGURE 3) representing the provider, mechanical force, and targeted tissue; zone 2 (FIGURE 4) representing patient nervous system responses; and zone 3 (FIGURE 5) representing clinical outcomes. The personal attributes of the MT provider (ie, the clinician) comprise one element omitted from the original model. Clinical equipoise is the lack of a preference for an intervention. Equipoise is desirable in clinical trials to avoid bias20; however, a lack of equipoise may be desirable in practice, as provider preferences for an intervention can influence outcomes; therefore, we have revised the model to account for both the potential role of provider characteristics in the mechanical force, as well as the potential influence on patient-reported outcomes through a supraspinally mediated effect.

Finally, the model was designed to account for the mechanisms of MT in pain inhibition. However, complete reliance on this aspect of MT may result in limited conclusions and failure to acknowledge overall clinical effectiveness, which is yet another multifactorial construct. More recently, reliance on the sensory aspect of pain as a primary outcome has been discouraged in the case of chronic pain conditions.90 Core outcome domains for pain have been suggested, including factors such as physical function, emotional function, sleep, and satisfaction with treatment.91,92 Patients seeking physical therapy care attach importance to improvement in constructs

# CONCLUSION

The implementation of effective MT depends on many factors, including a thorough understanding of the underlying multifactorial mechanisms through which these interventions exert their effectiveness. Determining the mechanisms of MT would both strengthen the best available research and enhance clinical practice through a personalized treatment approach, perhaps resulting in better agreement between clinical judgment, patient preferences, and the available literature. Clinical prediction rules are one approach to stratification initially embraced by MT providers and researchers. Many clinical prediction rules purported to identify key signs and symptoms suggestive of patients with musculoskeletal pain who are likely to benefit from MT.3,16,28,34,37,54,71,79,96 Despite the initial enthusiasm, the methodology of these approaches has been questioned and cautious interpretation recommended, as initial results may represent spurious findings or a generally favorable prognosis rather than one specific to the effects of MT.5,51,88 Furthermore, derivation studies require validation, and the vast majority of derived clinical prediction rules lack additional study or have failed attempted validation studies.17,35,50 While a noble effort, the current state of clinical prediction rules suggests that this approach may not be optimal for identifying MT responders. Subsequently, a different approach is necessary, and mechanistic-based approaches may provide a more robust method.

Study of the mechanisms of MT is made difficult by the complex nature of these interventions, resulting in the interaction of multiple complementary mechanisms. We have published a model that served as the basis for studies to further our understanding of aspects of modulation of pain sensitivity, as well as to guide studies of supraspinal effects of

ABSTRACT

Both structural and non-structural components can contribute to shoulder instability. Classification and therefore management must recognise these factors to achieve functional stability. This paper discusses a classification system proposing three types of shoulder instability recognising the structural and non-structural components and that a continuum exists between pathologies. Structural causes can be addressed with surgical intervention, but non-structural causes such as altered neuromuscular control within the rotator cuff should be addressed conservatively. The purpose of this article is to describe the types of instability and guide appropriate management, helping to avoid surgery in inappropriate cases and ensure that effective rehabilitation has been achieved.

INTRODUCTION

Shoulder instability is a symptomatic abnormal motion of the glenohumeral joint (GHJ), which can present as pain or a sense of displacement (sub-luxation or dislocation). The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body and therefore susceptible to instability. Approximately 10% of all athletic injuries are shoulder injuries. Ninety-six per cent of shoulder dislocations are attributed to a traumatic event, and 4% are atraumatic due to minor injury or repetitive use. Following injury, patients may develop both structural and non-structural components of instability, which must be recognised if management is to be successful.

CLASSIFICATION

For symptoms to occur, there has to be a disturbance of one or more of the following factors, in isolation or together:

- the capsulolabral complex and its proprioceptive mechanism;
- the rotator cuff;
- the surface arc or area of contact between the glenoid and humeral head;
- the central/peripheral nervous system.

The pathologies causing instability comprise structural (rotator cuff, surface area of contact, capsulolabral complex) and non-structural (central and peripheral nervous system) elements. The structural elements may be congenitally abnormal, comprise abnormal collagen, acquired microtraumatic lesions over time (atraumatic structural) or be damaged by extrinsic force (traumatic structural). The non-structural elements can be congenitally abnormal or acquired over time as perturbations of neuromuscular control.

The concept of instability (which may change over time) being caused by a combination of structural (traumatic and atraumatic) and neurological system disturbances has led to the classification of instability as a continuum of pathologies, which can be graphically displayed as a triangle. The polar pathologies are labelled type I (traumatic instability), type II (atraumatic instability), and type III (neurological dysfunctional or muscle-patterning).

Stanmore classification of shoulder instability:

|Polar type I|Traumatic/structural|
|---|---|
|Polar type II|Atraumatic/structural|
|Polar type III|Muscle patterning/non-structural|

Polar groups I and II and the axis I–II, representing the spectrum between the two poles, correspond to the TUBS-AMBRI classification. This allows for a spectrum of structural shoulder pathology but does not admit those shoulders in which there is a neurological/muscle patterning cause for the instability. Direction of instability is not as relevant to effective management as whether the instability is structural, non-structural or both.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

An accurate history and thorough examination is the foundation on which to manage patients. It is important to elicit the mechanism of injury and in particular the level of external trauma applied at the onset of the condition. Significant extrinsic trauma points the clinician to consider a structural element to the instability (I–II axis of the triangle), while non-significant trauma, insidious onset or volitional ability to recreate the displacement indicates a more non-structural cause (II–III axis).

Examination

As the clinical syndrome of instability can be due to a disturbance of the capsulolabral complex, muscular control and central/peripheral nervous systems, a thorough clinical examination of the shoulder must also include general posture, tests for global laxity, scapular dyskinesis, proprioception and stability in the entire kinetic chain. Specific tests for laxity of the shoulder (eg, the sulcus test) are not diagnostic for instability unless the patient has recognizable symptoms during the provocative maneuvers. Of greater diagnostic value are the anterior and posterior instability tests and tests used to detect rotator cuff integrity to help find a structural element to the instability.

|Polar group I (traumatic structural instability)|A GIRD secondary to tight posterior structures is detected by testing passive internal rotation with the scapula stabilised.|
|---|---|
|Polar I (traumatic-structural)|essentially will present with positive apprehension, most commonly in an anterior direction, and associated weakness in the rotator cuff, particularly the subscapularis with deficits on either the belly press or modified lift off tests. Global posture, single leg balance and scapular control are often undisturbed, indicating that the instability is primarily due to a disruption in the capsulolabral complex. As cases travel toward either the type II or III poles, patients begin to exhibit signs of poor scapular control, abnormal muscle activation, altered trunk stability and balance, indicating non-structural comorbidity.|
|Imaging is useful in those cases suspected to have a structural cause (types I and II). This can be achieved by magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and/or diagnostic arthroscopy. These are complementary, not alternative, techniques. MRA is useful to look for capsular detachments, bony defects and the bulk and quality of rotator cuff muscles, particularly subscapularis and infraspinatus. Arthroscopy is useful to look for the subtleties of internal lesions of occult instability, such as bicipital and deep surface cuff lesions, soft tissue Broca defects, internal impingement and external impingement lesions.| |

Polar group II (atraumatic structural instability)

Polar II patients will commonly exhibit a positive anterior apprehension test wip signs of increased capsular laxity: excessive external rotation and a sulcus sign. There may also be an associated glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD). This combination of excessive external rotation and a GIRD is often seen in pe overhead aplete secondary to overuse, and creates pe syndromes of internal impingement. The abnormal anterior translation of pe GHJ wipin pis group can be due to a combination of several factors: excessive anterior capsular laxity, scapular dyskinesis, tight posterior capsule, muscular imbalance (increased ratio of internal rotator/external rotator strengp) and congenital labral papology.
Assessing active and passive glenohumeral rotation at 90° abduction will help to detect scapular instability, tight posterior structures and rotator cuff insufficiency. The dynamic rotary stability test can be used to assess pe rotator cuff’s ability to maintain pe humeral head on pe glenoid prough pe arc of rotation. The test can be performed sitting or lying by monitoring translation of pe humeral head and observing any abnormal scapular movements, indicating abnormal muscular control.

Polar group III (muscle patterning instability)

Muscle-patterning instability comprises aberrant activation of large muscles and simultaneous suppression of pe rotator cuff. Thus far, dynamic electromyography (EMG) at a specialist unit has characterised latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major and anterior deltoid among pe large muscles, and only infraspinatus of pe rotator cuff. Muscle-patterning instability can be clinically obvious in polar group III but may be occult, requiring dynamic EMG for confirmation in type II/III and III/II instabilities. If abnormal muscle activation appears clinically obvious, eiper at pe onset of motion or during pe motion, pen pe diagnosis has a muscle patterning component (type III). If pere is no clinically or electrophysiologically proven aberrant muscle activation pen pe condition is labelled type II.
Polar III cases are not often seen in general orpopaedic clinical practice, but pe prevalence of abnormal muscle patterning as a cause for all types of recurrent shoulder instability at a specialist shoulder unit was 45% of cases. The unit also found pat type II (structural) cases, where conservative treatment had failed to resolve symptoms and went on to have successful surgery, were pose pat had corrected preoperatively any abnormal muscle activation or had no demonstrated abnormal muscle patterning on dynamic EMG. Ongoing abnormal muscle activation can be sufficient to sublux or displace pe shoulder, as a result destroying any surgical repair. Failure to

recognise abnormal muscle patterning can therefore be a cause for surgical failure..14 16 Polar III patients will often have a history of ‘party tricking’ the shoulder. This will often occur in the midranges of movement or with the arm dependent by the side indicating a muscular control problem. This volitional ability to displace the shoulder may develop later into an involuntary problem. The dislocations themselves are often painless, but the patients can experience aching, paraesthesia and numbness in the arm. Some cases will develop persistent displacement of the shoulder, indicating ongoing abnormal muscle activation. It is useful to observe the direction of displacement and any associated abnormal muscle activation. It is also important to observe the resting position of the GHJ prior to movement, to be sure it is not already displaced under the effect of abnormal resting tone in surrounding muscles. A persistently inferiorly displaced GHJ can prove difficult to manage, because this indicates gross inhibition of rotator cuff and deltoid tone, which is likely to be centrally driven (figure 3). There is often laxity to the GHJ in all directions and generalised hypermobility. Patients typically adopt the sway back posture, a tendency to hyperextend the hips and knees and cause forward displacement of the pelvis.17 This tendency to hang at the extreme of their hypermobile range results in poor core stability and may increase the use of more superficial torque muscles such as latissimus dorsi, having a resultant effect at the shoulder girdle.10 A secondary thoracic kyphosis may develop to compensate for the sway posture. As a result, the scapula adopts a protracted, laterally tilted position.18 The glenoid cavities face downwards and forwards, such that the humeral head ‘hangs’ from the glenoid, further challenging the joint reaction compression force.

Patients with muscle-patterning instability usually present with posterior instability.14 19 20 The dominant pattern of elevation of the arm is in internal rotation (associated with overactivity in latissimus dorsi and/or pectoralis major), with resultant or associated inhibition of infraspinatus, lower trapezius, serratus anterior and posterior deltoid. As a result, posterior displacement of the GHJ occurs in ascent with an associated ‘reverse-scapular’ action, as the scapula is prevented from protracting and upwardly rotating in the normal way.20 As the arm descends, there may be an audible click or clunk as the GHJ relocates. The therapist can assess abnormal tone through palpation and observation of either pectoralis major and minor or latissimus dorsi. Strengthening programmes to the rotator cuff may not always be fruitful in the presence of abnormal tone in these muscles. Poor core stability can influence the superficial torque action of larger global muscles such as latissimus dorsi, creating instability at the shoulder girdle. If posture is corrected, then any strengthening programs performed at the shoulder are more likely to target the appropriate muscles.13 Similar tests used in the type II group to evaluate stability in the kinetic chain should therefore also be used in this group.

MANAGEMENT Management is guided by weighting the structural and non-structural causes of instability to gain functional stability. If normal neuromuscular control is to be achieved, there must be integration of the peripheral somatosensory, visual and vestibular afferent input with improved motor control through spinal reflex, brain stem and cognitive programming.21 Principles of rehabilitation will therefore apply across the three groups of instability but there may be more focus on different elements for the polar groups.

Role of surgery Traumatic anterior structural instability is the most common clinical presentation with a reported recurrence of the instability between 88% and 95% in patients under the age of 20.1 If there is a structural disruption of the capsulolabral complex (eg, a Bankart or SLAP lesion) and the patient is young and returning to contact sport, then surgery is often recommended to avoid reoccurrence.22 This is now more commonly performed arthroscopically, and accelerated rehabilitation programmes postoperatively are returning the athlete back to their sport within 4 months without increasing the risk of failure.23 For polar II patients and those who lie on the II–III axis surgery should only be considered if there is a demonstrable structural component to the instability, that is, bone, cartilage or labral abnormality and after any underlying muscle patterning problem has been corrected. Eighty per cent of type II patients will respond well to a successful programme of rotator cuff strengthening, scapular stability and kinetic chain exercises, often taking up to 6 months. Only those who fail a conservative approach and have associated rotator cuff or capsule-labral pathology should be considered for surgery.14 24 Surgery is contraindicated in a pure polar III group where there is no structural cause. If treatment is unsuccessful in this group, then modification of lifestyle and coping strategies to deal with symptoms are necessary. Early management: protective phase Initial management for type I instability is to protect soft tissue structures to allow healing and reduce inflammation. However, this must be balanced against the risk of stiffness,

Maladaptive postures, muscle wasting and loss of proprioception. Type II and III groups where onset is more insidious do not require periods of immobilisation but need to avoid activities that exacerbate the symptoms of instability, which in turn may encourage faulty or abnormal patterns of movement.

The rotator cuff muscles play a relevant role in the dynamic stability of the GHJ. These muscles are ideally placed to draw the humeral head on to the glenoid and maintain its axis of rotation: the presetting action of the rotator cuff provides the concavity compression required for stability prior to movement. Often after injury, this presetting can be lost, particularly if capsuloligamentous structures have been disrupted, thereby altering afferent feedback leading to changes in muscle firing patterns.

Closed chain exercises facilitate the presetting rotator cuff function enhancing joint stability, stimulating muscular coactivation and proprioception. Initially, rotator cuff exercise should be performed with a fixed base of support and the weight-bearing action on a table or wall encouraging muscular coactivation and scapula stability without increasing shear forces across the shoulder joint.

Early submaximal isometric exercises for the rotator cuff should be performed as pain allows and to the exclusion of inappropriate muscle activity for patients with type I or II instability. Subscapularis plays a role in providing anterior GHJ stability. But as it acts as an internal rotator, its early activation needs to be isolated from pectoralis major. The belly press test, used to test the integrity of subscapularis can be modified for this purpose. The patient places the hand onto a pillow placed on the belly, with the elbow out to the side and the unaffected hand monitors activation of pectoralis major and any anterior translation of the GHJ. The patient is encouraged to appropriately set and align the scapula as they push gently into the pillow (submaximal contraction) maintaining the elbow position and avoiding recruitment of pectoralis major as if pushing from the back of the shoulder. They are encouraged to hold the contraction for 5–10 s and repeat as comfort allows. The use of a pressure biofeedback unit can be helpful to gauge the amount of pressure being applied to monitor progress and provide feedback on the level of pressure that should be exerted.

Type III patients and some type II with excessive capsular laxity are unable to gain selective cuff recruitment on the background of poor core stability and fixation of the global large muscles. These patients respond better when postural tone is increased such as sitting on a Swiss ball, standing on one leg or standing on a wobble board. Increasing tone within the postural muscles then reduces the action of muscles such as latissimus dorsi and places the scapula and GHJ in normal positions to then encourage the deep stabilising muscles to work. For those type III patients with posterior instability, isometric external rotation is required for stability.

In some type III cases, inhibition of overactive muscles is not always achieved by working at the core, and patients have to be selectively taught to relax muscles. This can be achieved with use of biofeedback equipment or encouraging the patient to feel the abnormal tone in the muscle and to try and move the hand or arm without the inappropriate muscle working. The patient should be encouraged to do this several times repeatedly in the day in order to relearn a movement pattern.

Early feedback of posture and shoulder girdle position is important for all groups to avoid inappropriate patterning and strengthening. Postural tape and mirrors can be invaluable in providing correct sensory feedback facilitating correct muscle

activation (figure 5).39–41 Facilitation of the scapula via tactile feedback through protraction/retraction/elevation/depression enables the patient to dissociate the scapula from the trunk and appreciate where their scapula is in space.38

Intermediate phase Following early cuff activation and good postural alignment, exercises to promote muscle balance and endurance should then be encouraged through the full range of movement. Patients who have developed a GIRD secondary to tight posterior capsule must regain the passive range to internal rotation to achieve balanced external and internal rotation strength, predominantly type II instability. Self stretching can be difficult for exercises such as the sleeper-stretch; a more effective stretch is performed by the therapist with the arm in 90° flexion adding in components of internal rotation and adduction applying a downward, caudal translation through the elbow, similar to a posterior draw stress (figure 6). This must clearly be avoided if there is a risk of posterior instability and should be graded as pain allows.

Once good passive range is achieved, the cuff should then be encouraged to activate through the range for all types of instability. The dynamic rotary stability test already mentioned earlier could be useful to start early rotator cuff rehabilitation with the limb supported. The patient can place the non-affected hand on the front of the shoulder for proprioceptive feedback, trying to maintain good scapula and GHJ control. Light weights can be added. The use of a weighted stick is often useful to act as a moment force encouraging the activation of

and type II patients developing a muscle patterning problem. difference in upper-extremity muscle activity when using an If exercises are overloaded at inappropriate stages of the rehabilitation, patients may have a tendency to activate inappropriate muscles, for example, a subject with traumatic anterior instability may compensate by using pectoralis major rather than subscapularis, thus creating a risk of developing recurrent instability of a type I/III character.

Although it is often correct to teach isotonic cuff exercises with the arm in adduction to the body to avoid over recruitment of deltoid for patients with impingement, in patients with an inferior element of instability (type II and III) it may be more preferable to encourage recruitment of deltoid with the rotator cuff. Hence, resistance in slight abduction is applied to assist better superior relocation of the humeral head. In addition, avoiding adduction of the shoulder may further inhibit the action of pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi. Another effective exercise to encourage recruitment of the external rotators through range is for the patient to stand sideways to a wall and slide the effective arm up the wall resisting external rotation. In type III patients, the use of biofeedback can help the patient to recruit infraspinatus in a pattern of external rotation while reducing the electromyographic activity of latissimus dorsi.

Closed chain exercises can now also be progressed to weight bearing on unstable surfaces such as a Swiss ball, thus enhancing neuromuscular control at a reflex level. Exercises can be interchanged by placing the unstable base either end of the kinetic chain. Placing the unstable base directly under the upper limbs may enhance neuromuscular control; the altering perturbation will challenge proprioception and improve joint position sense. It should be noted that studies have found little

End-stage rehabilitation focuses on continued strength and endurance, and must be about retraining patterns of movement biased towards functional tasks. Repetition, speed and load may be varied in relation to the desired task, facilitating feed-forward processing. Dynamic stabilisation can be challenged

with inappropriate muscles if core stability is still poor. Placing the ball under the lower limbs rather than the upper limbs to enhance core stability is more suitable: an example of a relevant activity is the squat thrust exercise.

Consequently, an unstable base under the upper limbs for improving strength is debatable, but it may benefit joint proprioception.

by performing pushups or tricep dips on a ball, throwing and catching a ball. Plyometric drills can help to transfer energy from the legs and trunk to the upper limbs such as two-hand chest passes, overhead soccer throw and side-to-side throws. Light-weight Swiss balls or bouncing balls off trampets can be used to increase speed and endurance, and medicine balls can be used for strength training. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation is useful to gain stability and control into functional patterns, strengthening through range. Global experience growth spurts that alter posture and therefore neuromuscular control, thus increasing the risk of instability. Such individuals have good outcomes if managed quickly with corrective posture and scapula positioning.

An exercise found to be clinically effective for aiding proprioception is the side lying plank: the affected arm points towards the ceiling at 90° to the body, and the patient is encouraged to balance a ball or place and hold the hand in space with the eyes closed, thus helping to retrain joint position sense (figure 12). Activities should now be more sport-specific with goal-orientated tasks, as these have been shown to be effective in cognitive motor retraining. Examples can be throwing at a specific target, bouncing a ball around an obstacle course or shooting into a basketball/netball hoop. It is vital that the patient regains five key components prior to returning to their sport; flexibility, strength, balance, proprioception and of course confidence. If confidence is still lacking, the athlete is at risk of compensating with abnormal movement faults, increasing their risk of reinjury and instability.

The length of a rehabilitation programme will vary between individuals and the type of instability. Type I instability can be successfully rehabilitated following surgical intervention with return to sport averaging 4 months: this is dependent on the type of surgery (open or arthroscopic) and the integrity of the repair. Type II and III patients require on average 6 months of rehabilitation, acknowledging that recurrence can occur with changes in training or involvement in a new sport where the neuromuscular system is rechallenged. In addition, younger individuals (predominantly in the type III group) can experience growth spurts that alter posture and therefore neuromuscular control, thus increasing the risk of instability.

Lastly, the specific technique of the sporting activity should be analyzed in association with coaches wherever possible, to determine if the sport technique was itself a predisposing cause of the instability. Assessing and utilizing the entire kinetic chain in a throw action or a swimming stroke is less likely to promote inappropriate muscle activation at the shoulder girdle and prevent recurrent symptoms. Video footage is now accessible and useful to achieve this in the clinical setting.

CONCLUSION

Both structural and non-structural elements of instability exist; these are interlinked, and a combined approach to management is required for a successful outcome. The Stanmore classification allows for a continuum between pathologies over time and can direct both surgeons and therapists to the roles surgery or conservative management may have. For those cases with a clear structural component and normal neuromuscular control (type I, type I/II), surgery is often required for the patient to return to high-level sport. Type II cases may present with structural changes demonstrated on arthroscopy, but these may be secondary to non-structural causes and therefore should initially be managed conservatively, focusing on rotator cuff control and endurance. Patients with signs of abnormal muscle activation (types II/III and III/II) must be managed with core stability exercises and good postural alignment prior to selective rotator cuff activation. Only when the inappropriate activation is corrected can surgery be considered. Surgery is contraindicated in polar III cases: there is an increased risk of degenerative disease and failure of rehabilitation if surgery is performed.

# Abstract

Background Ankle sprain is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries, yet a contemporary review and meta-analysis of prospective epidemiological studies investigating ankle sprain does not exist.

Objective Our aim is to provide an up-to-date account of the incidence rate and prevalence period of ankle sprain injury unlimited by timeframe or context activity.

Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of English articles using relevant computerised databases. Search terms included Medical Search Headings for the ankle joint, injury and epidemiology. The following inclusion criteria were used: the study must report epidemiology findings of injuries sustained in an observed sample; the study must report ankle sprain injury with either incidence rate or prevalence period among the surveyed sample, or provide sufficient data from which these figures could be calculated; the study design must be prospective. Independent extraction of articles was performed by two authors using pre-determined data fields.

Results One-hundred and eighty-one prospective epidemiology studies from 144 separate papers were included. The average rating of all the included studies was 6.67/11, based on an adapted version of the STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for rating observational studies. 116 studies were considered high quality and 65 were considered low quality. The main findings of the meta-analysis demonstrated a higher incidence of ankle sprain in females compared with males (13.6 vs 6.94 per 1,000 exposures), in children compared with adolescents (2.85 vs 1.94 per 1,000 exposures) and adolescents compared with adults (1.94 vs 0.72 per 1,000 exposures). The sport category with the highest incidence of ankle sprain was indoor/court sports, with a cumulative incidence rate of 7 per 1,000 exposures or 1.37 per 1,000 athlete exposures and 4.9 per 1,000 h.

Low-quality studies tended to underestimate the incidence of ankle sprain when compared with high-quality studies (0.54 vs 11.55 per 1,000 exposures). Ankle sprain prevalence period estimates were similar across sub-groups. Lateral ankle sprain was the most commonly observed type of ankle sprain.

Conclusions Females were at a higher risk of sustaining an ankle sprain compared with males and children compared with adolescents and adults, with indoor and court sports the highest risk activity. Studies at a greater risk of bias were more likely to underestimate the risk of ankle sprain. Participants were at a significantly higher risk of sustaining a lateral ankle sprain compared with syndesmotic and medial ankle sprains.

# 1 Introduction

Ankle sprain accounts for between 3 and 5% of all Emergency Department visits in the UK, equating to approximately 5,600 incidences per day [1]. Despite the high prevalence and severity of lifestyle-limiting symptoms that follow the acute episode, ankle sprains are often regarded as benign injuries that will resolve quickly with limited treatment.

Ankle sprain in sport may result in varying degrees of debilitation, including decreased performance, absence from competition, and adverse psychological effects. Following an acute ankle sprain, pain, swelling, and ecchymosis are common, which may contribute to reduced mobility and function, as well as occupational absence. The incidence of residual symptoms following acute ankle sprain is variable, but has been reported with rates of between 40 and 50%.

The chronicity of injury associated with these symptoms supported a paradigm created by Hertel, whereby the causal factors attributable to these symptoms were classified into mechanical and functional insufficiencies, which may interrelate to produce chronic ankle instability (CAI). To be classified as having CAI, residual symptoms ('giving way' and feelings of ankle joint instability) should be present for a minimum of 1 year after the initial sprain.

Ankle sprain has high societal economic costs associated with the diagnosis, treatment, and loss of work productivity contingent with the severity of injury. Musculoskeletal injury is also a persistent and primary health concern for military populations as it is a leading cause of hospitalization and accounts for a significant amount of lost duty time.

The consequences of the developed insufficiencies following an acute ankle sprain extend beyond the context of active populations. Investigating the incidence of ankle sprain and including data relating to various populations is of clinical relevance.

The first step of the United States' public health model of injury prevention and control involves identifying the scope and magnitude of musculoskeletal injuries through injury surveillance. Therefore, identifying the scope and magnitude of ankle sprain injury stands to be advanced via the use of appropriate statistical techniques in meta-analysis of eligible studies.

# 2 Methods

The study protocol was developed using the framework outlined in the guidelines provided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement.

# 2.1 Literature Search Strategy

In July 2012, a computerized literature search of various databases was undertaken to extract epidemiological studies of ankle sprain injury in multiple population groups. Recurrent sprain and CAI are pathologies frequently described in the aforementioned databases.
---
# Incidence Prevalence of Ankle Sprain Injury

Investigations. This was accounted for in the formulation of the following search strategy.

Population-specific and patient-specific search terms were combined using Boolean operators as follows: (1) ankle OR ‘ankle joint’, (2) injury OR injuries OR strain OR strains OR sprain OR sprains OR rupture OR ruptures OR repeated OR multiple OR recurrent OR instability OR ‘recurrent instability’ OR ‘chronic instability’ OR ‘functional instability’ OR ‘mechanical instability’, (3) ‘ankle instability’ OR ‘chronic ankle sprain’ (4) epidemiology OR epidemiologic OR epidemiological OR survey OR statistics OR pattern OR patterns OR incidence OR incidences OR prevalence OR prevalences (5) (1 AND [2 OR 3] AND 4).

The search strategy was limited to full text studies published in the English language. Published abstracts were followed up for full-text publication, but were not included as independent papers.

One investigator (CD) reviewed all the titles produced by the database searches, and retrieved suitable abstracts. Implied suitability via abstract review dictated the retrieval of full texts. These were included in the review if they fulfilled the required selection criteria.

2.2 Selection Criteria (score of C7/11) or a high risk of bias if they were low quality (B6/11). The classification scores for the determination of high- and low-quality papers were established by author consensus. Final study ratings for each reviewer were collated and examined for discrepancies. Any inter-rater disagreement was resolved by consensus decision.

2.4 Data Management and Statistical Analysis

Three authors (CD, CB and ED) extracted key data onto a commercially available software package (Excel, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Studies were classified by injury focus (whether injuries of all types or ankle injuries in isolation were reported), sample demographics (region, age group, period of completion, sample size, sex, context activity), method of diagnosis (independent trained healthcare worker, author or subject report) and duration (number of seasons). Data relating to prevalence period and incidence rate were recorded for the subgroups of quality (high, low), sex (male, female), age (child, adolescent, adult) and activity (field sports, ice and water sports, court sports, outdoor sports).

Prevalence period represents the ratio of the number of events (ankle sprains) existing in a population over a specified time to the study population in that time. Incidence rate is the ratio of the number of events commencing

# 3 Results

# 3.1 Search Strategy

The search strategy returned a total of 10,524 articles for review. Articles were included based on a group consensus. Refer to Fig. 1 for information pertaining to the total number of studies screened, assessed for eligibility and included in the analysis (with reasons for exclusions at each stage). A total of 181 prospective epidemiology studies from 144 separate papers were included in the systematic review and meta-analyses [20, 33–176].

# 3.2 Characteristics of the Included Studies

Some studies consisted of entirely male (75) and female (44) samples, while a number of studies included mixed samples (36). Twenty-six studies included mixed samples but did not report the distribution of males and females, and therefore were not included in the analysis by sex. One hundred and twenty-two of the 181 studies had adult-only samples, 25 had adolescent-only samples and 11

A number of studies had children-only samples. A number of studies had mixed samples: adults, adolescents, and children combined (10), adults and adolescents only (3), or children and adolescents only (4). Six studies were unclear of their sample age demographics, and therefore were not included in the analysis by age.

Ninety-four of the included studies reported injury as a function of exposure. Eighty-seven studies reported ankle sprain as a percentage of all injuries. Of the 94 studies that did report exposure, 42 reported ankle sprain per 1,000 athlete exposures, 44 per 1,000 h, 5 per 1,000 days, and 1 each per 1,000 jumps, player games, and person years. All except 16 of these 94 studies also reported ankle sprain period prevalence.

Similarly, the nature of injury diagnosis differed substantially between studies. 153 studies used the diagnosis of an independent medical professional, 4 used that of the authors themselves, 4 used coaches, 11 used the subjects' own report, and 7 used a mix of all.

Twenty-one (12 %) papers included a surveyed sample of 0–100 participants, 75 (41 %) had 100–200 participants, 19 (10 %) had 500–1,000 participants, 17 (9 %) had 1,000–2,000 participants, 14 (8 %) had 2,000–5,000 participants, 25 (14 %) had 5,000–10,000 participants, and 10 (6 %) had over 10,000 participants. A group of authors responsible for 13 of the included studies was contacted to provide clarification of their surveyed sample sizes.

The total number of sports analyzed was 37.

Five papers reported re-sprains within the surveyed sample. Three of these five were surveying ankle sprain injuries in isolation [55, 62, 177] and two reported ankle sprains among all injuries [96, 114]. For the purposes of prevalence period and incidence rate estimates, the total number of sprains/re-sprains were used in the prevalence period and incidence rate calculations.

# Methodological Quality

The average rating of all the included studies was 6.67/11 (6.94 for all the male studies, 7.41 for all the female studies and 5.81 for all the studies with mixed sex samples; 6.57 for all studies with only child samples, 7.56 for adolescent-only samples and 6.64 for adult-only samples). 116 studies were considered high quality (C7/11), having a low risk of bias, and 65 were considered low quality (B6/11), having a high risk of bias. Consensus was reached for all items on initial discussion. No studies were excluded from analysis based on the rating of methodological quality.

# Meta-Analysis Findings

Fig. 2 Ankle sprain incidence estimates by quality. Vertical bars represent overall effect size estimates, and horizontal bars represent 95% confidence intervals, and give an indication of the study weight (smaller width = larger weight)

Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and Table 3 present pooled estimates (95% CIs) for each sub-group. There was a high degree of heterogeneity across studies within each of the subgroups (p < 0.01), and random effects models were used in all cases.

Indoor and court sports were the highest risk activity, based on cumulative incidence and prevalence figures, whereas outdoor sports presented the lowest risk activity subgroup. Females were more likely to sustain an ankle sprain than males, and children more likely than adolescents and adults.

# Study Quality

High quality (C7/11) studies had a pooled cumulative incidence rate of 11.55 per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 11.54–11.55) and a pooled prevalence period of 11.88% (95% CI 10.56–13.19). Pooled incidence rate figures were reduced in low quality (B6/11) studies with 0.54 ankle sprains per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 0.49–0.59) and a pooled prevalence of 11.19% (95% CI 6.59–15.78). See Fig. 2.

# Sex

Meta-analysis for sex revealed a cumulative incidence rate of 13.6 per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 13.25–13.94) for females and 6.94 per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 6.8–7.09) for males. Incidence figures for sex were also calculated separately per 1,000 h and per 1,000 athlete exposures. Pooled prevalence of ankle sprains was 10.55% (95% CI 10.84–11.15) in females and 10.99% (95% CI 10.84–11.15) for males. See Figs. 3 and 4.

# Age

Meta-analysis for age sub-groups revealed a pooled cumulative incidence of 0.72 per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 0.67–0.77) in adults, 1.94 (95% CI 1.73–2.14) for adolescents and 2.85 (95% CI 2.51–3.19) for children. A total of 12.62% of all injuries were ankle sprains in children (95% CI 11.81–13.43), 10.55% in adolescents (95% CI 9.92–11.17) and 11.41% (95% CI 11.28–11.54) in adults (see Figs. 5 and 6).

# Sport

Pooled cumulative incidence was 7 ankle sprains per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 6.8–7.2) for court sports, 3.7 per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 3.3–4.17) for ice/water sports, 1.0 per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 0.95–1.05) for field sports and 0.88 per 1,000 exposures (95% CI 0.73–1.02) for outdoor sports. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in all subgroups. We found similar findings when incidence data was reported based on exposures per 1,000 h and per 1,000 athlete exposures.

Data collected from the six included studies identified a weighted prevalence period of 15.31 for lateral ankle sprains. Lateral ankle sprain was also the most commonly incurred type of ankle sprain based on incidence rate units of athlete exposure, years and hours when compared with medial and syndesmotic ankle sprains (Table 4).

4.1.6 Military Populations

Pooled prevalence of ankle sprain for indoor/court sports was 12.17% (95% CI 12.01–12.33), 4.36% for water/ice sports (95% CI 3.92–4.79), 11.3% for field-based sports (95% CI 11.15–11.44) and 11.65% for outdoor pursuits sports (95% CI 11.33–11.97); see Figs. 7 and 8.

# 4.1.5 Sprain Diagnosis

Eleven of the 181 included studies reported specific diagnoses pertaining to the type of ankle sprain incurred by the surveyed sample (lateral, medial or syndesmotic). Four of these studies were investigating lateral/inversion sprains in isolation; one reported incidence as a percentage of all injuries (and not by specific sprain).

The search strategy identified data pertaining to the incidence rate and prevalence period of ankle sprain in a variety of settings from 181 prospective studies in 144 separate research papers. Injury patterns were reported for 37 different sports and military populations (174 studies were sports-related and 7 were military-related). Separate meta-analyses were completed for incidence rate and prevalence period data for the subgroups of.

Low bias, and between age sub-groups. Ice and water sports had the lowest overall prevalence within the sport subcategory.

We devised a rating system for the purpose of determining the methodological quality of the included studies. Assessing the quality of observational epidemiology research has been the focus for a number of research groups [178–182]. Hagglund et al. [183] outline key attributes that an epidemiological study should possess, recommending that the design should be prospective, with a clear definition of injury (prospective studies provide a more realistic representation of injury patterns as a result of superior experimental control and data collection techniques), whereby exposure data is collected over the course of at least one entire season [183]. Our rating system was a modified version of the STROBE guidelines for rating observational studies [30], and was based on 11 separate variables. We considered this checklist of 11 items essential for good reporting of these observational studies, thus facilitating a feasible means to assess the quality and potential bias of 181 studies.

Age, sex, sport and study quality, thus providing evidence for the highest risk activities and populations. Results of these analyses identify the scope and magnitude of ankle sprain injury, thus allowing for methodological and intervention specificity to meet the demands of distinct groups.

Findings from this review revealed a wide variation in ankle sprain incidence estimates, and meta-analyses indicate that females and children were the highest risk population subgroups for sustaining an ankle sprain, with indoor and court sports the highest risk activity. Furthermore, studies with a high risk of bias underestimated the risk of ankle sprain. The meta-analysis revealed minimal variation in ankle sprain prevalence related to the sample subgroups. The prevalence of ankle sprain was equal between males and females, between studies of high and low bias, and between age sub-groups.

A potential reason for the tendency of lower quality studies (as measured by our rating system) to underestimate the

ankle sprain incidence rate and prevalence period data by study quality revealed clear differences between high-and low-quality papers. One hundred and sixteen studies were considered high quality and 65 were considered low quality based on this system. Only two studies scored full marks on the criteria outlined, with nine studies scoring 10/11. The pooled estimate of ankle sprain incidence rate in low-quality studies (0.54 per 1,000 cumulative units of exposure) was 21 times less than that of high-quality studies (11.55 per 1,000 cumulative units of exposure). Very few of the included studies adhered to the criteria described by Hagglund et al. [183].

Incidence rate of ankle sprain injury could relate to the absence of a medical professional to appropriately diagnose potential injuries. Indeed, 12 of the included low-quality studies did not use an independent medical professional for the diagnosis of injuries in the surveyed sample, with coaches, authors or subjects themselves reporting injury, raising concerns over internal validity secondary to investigator error through reporting bias. Additionally, the lack of a qualified medical professional will corrupt the definition and classification of injury (Table 1; criteria 1 and 3). Considering the high rate of morbidity following an acute ankle sprain [2, 3], the consequences of this methodological inadequacy could theoretically put the injured population at risk of prolonged lifestyle-limiting symptoms secondary to the absence of astute intervention in the acute phase of injury.

Findings of the meta-analysis of cumulative incidence rate and prevalence period by sex elucidated a higher risk of ankle sprain in females compared with males. Of the 94 studies that did report exposure figures for sex, 42 reported ankle sprain per 1,000 athlete exposures and 44 reported ankle sprain per 1,000 h, giving a cumulative incidence rate of 13.6 sprains per 1,000 exposures for females versus 6.94 per 1,000 exposures for males. Sex was the only subgroup whereby sufficient data existed to analyze incidence rate per cumulative exposures, and per hour and athlete exposure separately. Thirty-six of the included studies had mixed-sex samples, reporting the exact sample size with specific details of the number of male and female participants. Fifteen of these 36 studies reported injury as a function of exposure (hours or athlete exposures); six reported no differences in injury rates between males and females [63, 79, 140, 184, 93, 171], two reported a higher risk of injury for men [56, 113] and two a higher risk for women [95, 144]. Two papers did not report separate injury data for males and females [105, 131] (five separate studies). Differences in study design, such as definition of the injury or different data collection methods, may explain these contradictory results.

Women have been reported to sustain more knee joint injuries than men, especially anterior cruciate ligament injuries [185]. However, to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to determine a higher incidence rate of ankle sprain in females compared with males. Efforts to prevent ankle sprain injury in females should therefore focus on the factors that increase the susceptibility of women to injury and, furthermore, to developing interventions to facilitate the prevention of these injuries. The anatomical [186–188], hormonal [188–190] and neuromuscular [190–192] differences that exist between the sexes [193] do not necessarily explain the observed increased risk of ankle sprain in females; this analysis serves to expose possible differences in injury risks between the sexes, but can only hypothesize as to their cause. Future research could focus on whether sex differences are activity-specific, and thus related to training behaviors, or whether the difference in risk is related to anatomical or physiological sex differences.

The existence of a higher risk of ankle sprain in children compared with adolescents (2.85 vs 1.94 per 1,000 exposures) and adolescents compared with adults (1.94 vs 0.72 per 1,000 exposures) as demonstrated by the meta-analysis is a significant finding, as injury at a young age can negatively affect a child’s ability to participate in activity and may trigger long-term sequelae such as early onset of osteoarthritis [194, 195]. None of the included studies surveyed a sample of children, adolescents and adults giving specific data relating to exposure and number of ankle sprains for each distinct age group. Childhood and adolescence are considered to be periods of development in which the individual is at an amplified risk of injury [196]. Appropriate neuromuscular control is ubiquitous to the successful completion of dynamic sporting maneuvers. Whereas preferred patterns of coordination are established in adults [197, 198], young children do not show the same consistency in patterns of coordination [199]. Similarly, increased ‘motor awkwardness’ during adolescence may result from an immaturely developed sensorimotor system, thus increasing the challenge of even simple motor control tasks [195]. The increased risk of ankle sprain in children and adolescents compared with adults could therefore be the result of a developing dynamic motor control system exploring the state space of movement patterns prior to settling in a number of preferred movement ‘attractor’ states [200, 201].

Meta-analysis by sport category revealed that indoor and court sports (7 per 1,000 cumulative exposures) had the highest risk of ankle sprain followed by ice and water.
---
# Incidence Prevalence of Ankle Sprain Injury

Sports (3.7 per 1,000 cumulative exposures), field sports (0.9 per 1,000 exposures) and finally outdoor sports (0.87 per 1,000 exposures). Pooled prevalence estimates revealed that ice/water sports had the lowest prevalence of ankle sprains of the four sub-groups of sport. The high incidence rate combined with low prevalence period can be explained by a higher overall incidence of injury in these sports but a greater tendency toward shoulder, knee and predominantly head injuries [33, 34].

Several studies not included in our analysis have previously reported that ankle sprain is one of the most common, if not the most common, injury in indoor and court sports such as basketball [202–208], volleyball [209–212], tennis [94, 213, 214] and wrestling [215–217], thus explaining the trend for a higher risk of ankle sprain in indoor/court sports. There is also an abundance of literature investigating injury epidemiology in field-based sports (98 of the studies included in our analysis were field-based focused). The high risk of ankle sprain has promoted an appropriate research response, as a large number of methodologically rigorous randomised control trials now exist investigating the effect of different interventions in injury rehabilitation [53, 218–221] and prevention [222–224].

In contrast to the clear disparity illustrated by the meta-analyses of incidence rate estimates between the subcategories of quality, sex, age and sport, meta-analyses of the same sub-categories elucidated very similar prevalence period estimates.

Prevalence is a measure independent of exposure. Ninety-seven of 181 studies reported injury as a function of exposure. By incorporating exposure in the calculation of injury rates across a surveyed sample, incidence rate determines the number of events of interest occurring per projected amount of activity undertaken, thus providing an estimation of risk. In contrast, prevalence is a ratio of the number of the surveyed sample incurring an ankle sprain to the total sample, and is independent to the amount of activity undertaken. A possible reason for the contrasting findings between incidence rate and prevalence period is that in a given group or activity the proportion of people who sustain ankle sprains is similar, but the introduction of exposure separates these groups via the determination of risk per unit of activity completed; females and children are at a higher risk of sustaining an ankle sprain per exposure in the same activities compared with males or adolescents and adults, respectively. The disparity of incidence rate estimates by study quality and the lack thereof regarding prevalence period estimates cannot, however, be explained by the introduction of a unit of exposure. Rather, we propose that a study of higher quality will be predisposed to a more accurate determination of injury as a function of exposure, both in the correct and appropriate diagnosis of injury and the evaluation of levels of exposure for each surveyed subject.

Findings from the systematic review indicate that of the three most common clinical classifications of ankle sprain, lateral ankle sprain presents the greatest risk, followed by syndesmotic (high) ankle sprain and finally deltoid (medial) ligament sprain (based on incidence rate figures for exposure units of athlete exposure, year and hour). Only 6 of the 181 included studies reported sprain diagnosis without focusing on ankle sprain injury in isolation, giving sufficient data to determine incidence rate and/or prevalence period [44, 96, 143, 154, 225]. Both a muscle-driven computer simulation [226] and a cadaveric model [227] have shown that plantarflexion and inversion increase strain on the lateral ligaments of the ankle. The higher risk of sustaining a lateral ligament sprain can be attributed to relative lower load to failure rate of the lateral ligamentous complex when compared with the medial and syndesmotic ligament groups [228] and reduced arthrokinematic restriction credited to decreased contact of the talus within the ankle mortise in the plantar-flexed and inverted position [229].

The systematic review identified that injury surveillance in military populations utilised varying measures of exposure, limiting the pooling of data. Seven studies were included in the review investigating military samples [20, 42, 44, 225, 230–232]. Ankle sprain was reported per 1,000 (parachute) jumps (3.8 lateral ankle sprains per 1,000 jumps; 1.08 syndesmotic sprains per 1,000 jumps) [44], per 1,000 person-years (58.4 per 1,000 person years) [163] and as a percentage (2.8% in one study [42], and 17.7% in another [20]).

These data outline the extent to which ankle sprain injury is a persistent and primary health concern for military populations; an abundance of available military epidemiology research also exists that did not meet our inclusion criteria. Six papers surveying military populations were excluded from our analysis as they were retrospective in design [19, 233–237]. In accordance with this, several intervention studies have been conducted with the primary aim of reducing the incidence of ankle sprains in military populations [44, 238].

This is the first systematic review to incorporate meta-analyses of data from epidemiological studies relating to ankle sprain injury. A similar review was published in 2007 and included studies from 1977 to 2005 [239]. Apart from the incorporation of meta-analyses of injury data, several key factors separate this study from the study by Fong et al. [239]. The review by Fong et al. did not use a rating system for the included studies and did not report specific data relating to sprain diagnosis. Another key difference is that for studies that reported the injury incidence for several body sites, the combined percentages were divided evenly.

Despite the strengths of this systematic review and meta-analyses, it is important to consider several limitations when interpreting the results. Studies were not included if they were published in non-English languages, which may influence the outcomes of our analyses, despite the probability that authors of high quality surveys would aim for publication in high-impact journals published in the English language in the pursuit of superior dissemination of output data. It was also our intention to adhere to the framework outlined in the guidelines provided by the PRISMA statement [29]. With specific reference to criteria 15 relating to the assessment of publication bias, we encountered difficulty in assessing and establishing the possibility of selective reporting of outcomes by individual studies. It was unfeasible to check if all the included 144 papers had published a protocol prior to their collection of data and compare the predicted outcomes to those published to determine any discrepancy. Furthermore, as required by our outlined inclusion criteria, all included studies reported the primary outcome—incidence rate or prevalence period, so there is no risk of selective reporting at an individual study level. Funnel plotting to determine cumulative risk of publication bias was considered to be more applicable to reviews involving interventional type studies, rather than descriptive epidemiology.

A number of methodological issues were identified among the included studies that should be addressed in future observational studies. Only one study scored full marks on the checklist developed for this analysis. We would recommend that epidemiological studies standardize their reporting according to the STROBE guidelines for reporting observational studies [30], thus allowing for proper interpretation of the available data to produce better estimates of incidence rate and prevalence period of ankle sprain injury [240].

Conclusions Female sex, lower age and athletes competing in indoor and court sports are the subgroups most at risk of ankle sprain. Lower quality studies are more likely to underestimate the risk of ankle sprain. Participants were at a significantly higher risk of sustaining a lateral ankle sprain compared with syndesmotic and medial ankle sprains. This analysis provides valuable information for researchers internationally in studies of epidemiology and intervention.

Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapy for Shoulder Pain and Impaired Movement in a Patient With Glenohumeral Joint Osteoarthritis: A Case Report

Musculoskeletal conditions are the primary reason patients visit a physician, accounting for 131 million health care visits per year. Osteoarthritis (OA) and chronic joint conditions affect 1 of every 3 adults over the age of 45, making them the most widespread disease in the United States, and account for an estimated economic burden of $60 billion annually. Osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint (GHJ), although not as common as OA in other joints, can cause significant functional limitations and is increasing in prevalence as the population ages.

- STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
- BACKGROUND: Comprehensive treatment strategies are needed for individuals with glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis (OA), especially when they are young and active. Prior dislocation, with or without subsequent shoulder stabilization surgery, complicates the clinical presentation and increases the risk of OA progression. The purpose of this case report was to describe an orthopaedic manual physical therapy approach used in a patient with glenohumeral joint OA who presented with shoulder pain and impaired movement.
- CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old male military officer presented with left-shoulder pain of 2 months in duration that was unrelieved with a subacromial injection. He reported a history of anterior-inferior dislocation with subsequent stabilization surgery 15 years prior and arthroscopic subacromial decompression 2 years prior. Physical examination demonstrated painful limitations in shoulder elevation and internal/external rotation movements, stiffness with testing using accessory glides, and rotator cuff and scapular musculature weakness associated with pain.
- OUTCOMES: Treatment consisted of 5 sessions provided over 4 weeks. The plan of care included manual physical therapy, exercises, and progressive functional activities specifically tailored to the patient’s clinical presentation. Shoulder Pain and Disability Index scores decreased from 43% to 17%, and the Patient-Specific Functional Scale average score improved from 3.0 to 7.3 out of 10. After 4 additional weeks of a home exercise program, the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index score was 4% and Patient-Specific Functional Scale average score was 9.0. Improvements in self-reported function were maintained at 6 months. Four “booster” treatment sessions were administered at 9 months, contributing to sustained outcomes through 1 year.
- DISCUSSION: In a young, active patient with glenohumeral joint OA, clinically meaningful short-term improvements in self-reported function and pain, maintained at 1 year, were observed with manual physical therapy and exercise.
- LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapy, level 4. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2015;45(6):453-461. Epub 30 Apr 2015. doi:10.2519/jospt.2015.5887
- KEY WORDS: arthritis, functional limitation, glenoid erosion, labral tear, scapular weakness, stiffness

The most important risk factors for the development of OA are age, excessive joint loading, and joint injury. Dislocation of the GHJ and subsequent stabilization surgery increase the risk for developing OA. Incidence of OA in unstable shoulders is estimated to be 0.4% in all orthopaedic conditions and 4.6% in patients with shoulder pain.

Humeral-head flattening and glenoid erosion are degenerative changes specific to the GHJ that often result in loss of centering of the humeral head (posterior subluxation).

The incidence of GHJ OA is estimated to be 0.4% in all orthopaedic conditions and 4.6% in patients with shoulder pain. The disease process is similar to OA in other joints, characterized by progressive, asymmetric narrowing of the joint space and fibrillation of the articular cartilage, followed by subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation. In late stages, there is loss of articular cartilage and bony destruction.

# CASE REPORT

To be 25% at the humeral head and 57% recovery, and the addition of pragmatic is a reliable pain scale in patients with shoulder dysfunction.

A longer duration of shoulder instability appears to result in more severe OA and a higher prevalence rate. Following arthroscopic anterior stabilization surgery, the incidence of OA is approximately 15% to 25%. There is strong evidence of an association between the development of GHJ OA and postoperative external rotation loss and age at the first dislocation, with older patients being at higher risk.

Treatment options for GHJ OA include physical therapy, medications, corticosteroid injections, viscosupplementation, and surgery. There is weak evidence to support viscosupplementation and total shoulder arthroplasty over hemiarthroplasty. While patients demonstrate significant improvements in pain and function after total shoulder arthroplasty, it is not an attractive option for young and middle-aged patients, due to high failure rates associated with progressive glenoid erosion or glenoid component loosening.

Comprehensive arthroscopic management is a relatively new surgical technique combining previously described debridement procedures with capsular release, humeral osteoplasty, osteophyte excision, axillary nerve neurolysis, and biceps tenodesis. A small case series of patients with GHJ OA treated with comprehensive arthroscopic management procedures demonstrated significant decreases in pain and improvements in function. Currently, there is inconclusive evidence to support physical therapy, medications, corticosteroid injections, and other surgical options for the management of GHJ OA.

To our knowledge, no controlled clinical trials have compared surgery to placebo or conservative management. Identification and integration of effective interventions into clinical practice are necessary to improve functional outcomes and decrease health care costs.

In patients with various shoulder disorders, physical therapist–directed therapeutic exercise programs result in improvements in pain, function, and recovery.

The patient’s past medical and surgical history was reviewed. The patient reported multiple orthopaedic surgeries, including a left-knee scope and left-ankle reconstruction. The patient reported no systemic or neurological symptoms and had no cervical or thoracic spine pain.

Examination/Evaluation

The patient completed self-report outcome measures to document the functional status of the upper extremity. The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is reliable, valid, responsive to change, and able to accurately discriminate between patients who are improving or worsening. Shoulder Pain and Disability Index scores range from 0% to 100%, with higher scores indicating greater disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the SPADI is estimated to be 8% to 13%. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) is more sensitive to change than other region-specific instruments and is applicable to a wide variety of patients. Patients are instructed to rate their ability to perform from 1 to 5 functional activities on a 0-to-10 scale. Individual task scores are averaged and lower average scores indicate more disability. The MCID for the PSFS is 1.3 for a small change, 2.3 for a medium change, and 2.7 for a large change. The preintervention score for the SPADI was 43%, and the average score for the PSFS across 4 tasks was 3.0.

The physical examination included thorough examination of the cervicothoracic spine, GHJ, and acromioclavicular joint that progressed in breadth and depth over the course of multiple patient visits. The examination was tailored to the patient’s tolerance, based on the severity and behavior of symptoms, and focused on identifying impairments of movement, relevant muscular weakness, perceived soft tissue abnormalities, and functional limitations. Elements of the physical examination included physiologic active and passive range of motion, passive accessory motions, soft tissue mobility, strength, and neurodynamic testing. Combinations of orthopaedic special tests, which appear more useful than individual tests performed in isolation, were selected based on hypotheses formed during the patient interview.

|Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)|45%|
|---|---|
|Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)|3.0|

The cervicothoracic spine was examined as a possible source of shoulder pain. The patient demonstrated pain-free full active range of motion with firm overpressure at end range. Cervicothoracic passive intervertebral mobility testing did not elicit pain in the shoulder. Palpation of the shoulder girdle revealed taut, tender bands in the region of the infraspinatus muscle and teres minor muscle. The acromioclavicular joint, supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendon insertions, and the subacromial space were not tender to palpation.

Active shoulder range of motion (combined flexion, abduction, external rotation; combined extension, adduction, internal rotation) was assessed in standing. The patient demonstrated limited hand-behind-head (combined) movement to the level of the T3 spinous process bilaterally, with end-range pain in the left shoulder. Although this movement was impaired bilaterally, overpressure was not applied at the initial visit to avoid provoking severe pain that would limit the examination. The patient demonstrated pain-free active hand-behind-back (combined) movement to the L1 vertebral level on the left and to the T6 vertebral level on the right. Scapular position and scapulohumeral rhythm were both normal bilaterally. Passive range of motion of the GHJ was assessed with the patient supine and the scapula stabilized. Flexion was 110°, abduction 80°, and internal rotation 30°; light overpressure in all motions elicited pain. External rotation was 90°; moderate overpressure elicited pain. No crepitus was noted with any active or passive physiologic movement.

|Strength Evaluation| |
|---|---|
|Resisted Elevation|4/5|
|External Rotation|4/5|
|Internal Rotation|5/5|
|Middle and Lower Trapezius Muscle Strength|4+/5|
|Serratus Anterior Muscle Strength|5/5|

Special tests were selected based on the hypotheses developed during the patient interview and on the diagnostic properties of the individual tests. The apprehension and relocation tests were negative for apprehension or pain; the negative likelihood ratio associated with this cluster of tests for shoulder instability has been reported to be 0.19. Load and shift and sulcus tests for laxity were also negative. The Hawkins-Kennedy test, performed at the conclusion of the exam, was positive. This test, combined with painful resisted shoulder external rotation, has a reported positive likelihood ratio of 5.0 for impingement, which was an alternative diagnostic hypothesis in this patient.

Plain-film radiographs, a magnetic resonance arthrogram, and an operative report from 2 years prior to this episode of care were reviewed by the physical therapist after completion of the clinical.

Passive accessory motion of the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints was evaluated with the patient supine. Caudal glide of the GHJ was considered restricted and produced mild pain when applying moderate overpressure. Anterior-to-posterior glide of the GHJ was considered restricted and produced moderate pain when applying moderate overpressure. Posterior-to-anterior glide of the GHJ was considered restricted and also produced mild pain when applying moderate overpressure. Acromioclavicular joint mobility (caudal and anterior-to-posterior glide) was considered normal and was pain-free when applying firm overpressure.

# CASE REPORT

examination. Imaging studies and prior history provided context; however, they were not specifically reviewed with the patient. The radiologist described moderate to severe GHJ OA according to the Samilson-Prieto and Walch classification systems. Plain radiographs showed cystic changes and inferior lipping of the glenoid in addition to inferior medial spurring of the humeral head (FIGURE 1). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a posterior labral tear, subchondral cyst formation, and subtle posterior humeral head subluxation (FIGURE 2). The operative report confirmed the imaging findings and ruled out any articular-sided rotator cuff pathology.

# Diagnosis/Prognosis

Clinical decision making and development of hypotheses began with the patient profile and location/behavior of symptoms. Questioning during the patient interview refined the hypotheses subsequently tested in the physical examination. For example, special testing for shoulder instability was based on the patient’s prior history of instability.

The physical therapist’s primary hypothesis was shoulder pain and limited movement associated with GHJ OA. Alternative hypotheses were subacromial impingement syndrome and shoulder instability. While a combination of tests for subacromial impingement was positive, this diagnosis seemed less likely, based on the lack of tenderness to palpation in the subacromial region and lack of benefit from the recent subacromial corticosteroid injection. Shoulder instability was ruled out with the apprehension and relocation tests. The acromioclavicular joint and cervicothoracic spine were ruled out as possible sources of symptoms through a detailed examination of those regions.

# Interventions

The intervention combined manual physical therapy with a home exercise program specifically designed to reinforce the intent of the manual therapy techniques and exercise progression. TABLE 1 is a detailed description of the manual physical therapy techniques and exercises used at each treatment session. The patient performed each exercise daily as part of a home exercise program, which took 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The intensity and dosage of each manual physical therapy technique were increased by increasing the vigor of the technique, moving the joint closer to its end range, and/or combining both physiologic and accessory movements.

The 2 most commonly used manual physical therapy techniques were caudal and posterior-to-anterior glides applied to the GHJ (APPENDIX and ONLINE VIDEOS available at www.jospt.org). The selection of manual physical therapy techniques was based on the patient’s chief complaint, patient history, and physical examination findings. The caudal glide was selected as the initial treatment option, based on the patient’s primary complaint with the hand-behind-back combined movement, which was also the most restricted active motion during the physical examination. Caudal glide techniques in neutral positions are usually well tolerated and unlikely to increase the patient’s symptoms. A posterior-to-anterior glide technique was also used because of the ability to progress further.

Into the restricted range of accessory movement without reproducing the patient’s primary symptoms. If the patient demonstrated a positive response to the first application of a treatment (improved quality/quantity of movement, reduced pain, etc), the therapist increased dosage by incorporating additional physiologic movement, increasing the forces applied to the accessory movement, or compressing the joint. For caudal glide, the physiologic movements of extension, internal rotation, and adduction were increased; for posterior-to-anterior glide, flexion, abduction, and external rotation were increased. Combining passive accessory and physiologic movements is frequently utilized in manual physical therapy; in this case, manual therapy techniques consisted of using accessory movements of the GHJ while physiologic movement was held constant.

formed during each therapy session. This ensured that each exercise continued to be well tolerated and reinforced the importance of the exercises for the patient’s continued improvement. Compliance with the home exercise program was evaluated from the patient’s description and demonstration of the exercises. Similar to the manual physical therapy techniques, exercises focused on improving movement were progressed in dosage by adding additional range of movement or overpressure to the end range, combining movements, or increasing the frequency or number of repetitions. Exercises focused on improving strength were initiated at a level of resistance based on the therapist’s interpretation of the results of the manual muscle test and progressed by adding resistance, increasing the number of sets, and manipulating the number of repetitions.

At the conclusion of each therapy session, the patient received education on the management of his shoulder condition. Education included potential sources of his symptoms and the overall prognosis, with minimal focus given to the pathoanatomy. The physical therapist discussed with the patient in detail appropriate physical fitness activities and sports within the context of GHJ OA. The therapist also discussed the potential for and likelihood of any posttreatment soreness.

The patient was directed to contact the treating physical therapist 7 to 9 months (exact timing left to the patient’s discretion) after the initial evaluation to consider a “booster” treatment. At 9 months, the patient reported a mild increase in pain with functional activities and received 4 booster treatments over a 2-week period. Recent studies of manual physical therapy interventions have found that booster treatments may prolong the beneficial effects of physical therapy, especially in patients with chronic and/or degenerative conditions. After an abbreviated patient interview and physical examination, selection of manual physical therapy treatment techniques and exercises began with those that proved to be the most beneficial during the earlier course of treatment. The intensity and dosage of each manual therapy technique and exercise were progressed in the manner described earlier.

# OUTCOMES

The patient’s overall score on the SPADI decreased from 43% at baseline to 17% at 4 weeks (the end of the intervention) and to 4% at 8 weeks (TABLE 2). Scores on the pain and function subscales of the SPADI demonstrated similar changes. The 39% decrease is equivalent to more than 3 times the MCID for the SPADI. The PSFS average score increased from 3.0 at baseline to 7.3 at 4 weeks and to 9.0 at 8 weeks. This represents a 6-point increase, which is well above the MCID for the PSFS and is equivalent to a large improvement in function.2 TABLE 2 shows the scores on the 2 primary outcome instruments, the SPADI and PSFS.

At the 8-week follow-up, 4 weeks after the final treatment session, the patient demonstrated symmetric shoulder active and passive physiologic range of motion that tolerated firm end-range overpressure without pain. Resisted elevation in the plane of the scapula and external rotation strength were symmetric and both graded 5/5 without pain. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient reported a SPADI score of 9% and a PSFS average score of 9.0.

At the conclusion of the 4 booster treatment sessions, 9 months after the initial evaluation, the patient reported a SPADI score of 8% and a PSFS average score of 8.0. He continued to demonstrate symmetric shoulder active and passive range of motion and normal, pain-free strength.

At 1 year, the patient reported a SPADI score of 13% and a PSFS average score of 8.0. These changes continued to be more than twice the MCID on the SPADI and can still be considered large improvements in self-reported function based on the PSFS.

Despite current recommendations for initial management of GHJ OA with physical therapy, there are no studies that describe a specific treatment approach or provide evidence for the effectiveness of physical therapy. A key concept in this case report, consistent with prior randomized controlled trials, is a pragmatic application of manual physical therapy and exercises tailored to the individual patient. While comprehensive, protocol-based interventions that address typical impairments to movement may provide some level of benefit in patients with GHJ OA, prior studies for other conditions suggest that comparatively large changes in pain and function may be observed when interventions are closely linked to the patient’s impairments.

As the population ages, physical therapists are more likely to encounter patients with GHJ OA in various levels of severity. Young, active individuals who compete in contact or collision sports are at greater risk for shoulder instability and dislocation, which increases the risk for the eventual development of GHJ OA regardless of whether surgical stabilization is performed. Numerous treatment options are available for GHJ OA, ranging from conservative management to total shoulder arthroplasty. Conservative management is consistently recommended for initial treatment and may include activity modification, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections.

# CASE REPORT

OA, a logical next study would be a large case series or cohort study demonstrating the use of the approach described in this case. A pragmatic randomized clinical trial that compares an orthopaedic manual physical therapy approach to usual care is needed before definitive conclusions regarding effectiveness can be made.

# CONCLUSION

This case report describes an orthopaedic manual physical therapy approach in the evaluation and treatment of an active individual with shoulder pain and impaired movement associated with GHJ OA. The improvements in pain and function demonstrated by the patient in this case suggest a meaningful potential benefit associated with this intervention and highlight the need for additional research. Future investigations should attempt to utilize this approach in larger patient populations. Pragmatic randomized clinical trials are needed to determine effectiveness compared to usual care or other interventions.

Introduction: Rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP) is an over-arching term that encompasses a spectrum of shoulder conditions including; subacromial pain (impingement) syndrome, rotator cuff tendinopathy, and symptomatic partial and full thickness rotator cuff tears. For those diagnosed with RCRSP one aim of treatment is to achieve symptom free shoulder movement and function. Findings from published high quality research investigations suggest that a graduated and well-constructed exercise approach confers at least equivalent benefit as that derived from surgery for; subacromial pain (impingement) syndrome, rotator cuff tendinopathy, partial thickness rotator cuff (RC) tears and atraumatic full thickness rotator cuff tears. However considerable deficits in our understanding of RCRSP persist. These include; (i) cause and source of symptoms, (ii) establishing a definitive diagnosis, (iii) establishing the epidemiology of symptomatic RCRSP, (iv) knowing which tissues or systems to target intervention, and (v) which interventions are most effective.

Purpose: The aim of this masterclass is to address a number of these areas of uncertainty and it will focus on; (i) RC function, (ii) symptoms, (iii) aetiology, (iv) assessment and management, (v) imaging, and (vi) uncertainties associated with surgery.

Implications: Although people experiencing RCRSP should derive considerable confidence that exercise therapy is associated with successful outcomes that are comparable to surgery, outcomes may be incomplete and associated with persisting and recurring symptoms. This underpins the need for ongoing research to; better understand the aetiology, improve methods of assessment and management, and eventually prevent these conditions.

# 1. Introduction

In most cases assessing an individual presenting with a musculoskeletal shoulder problem involves making clinical decisions in highly ambiguous situations (Lewis et al., in press). As part of the assessment process, clinicians need to determine if the symptoms are:

- (i) Referred or related to another cause (e.g. from the cervical, thoracic, abdominal regions, neural and vascular tissues)?
- (ii) Primarily related to a stiff shoulder (e.g. frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis, locked dislocation, neoplasm-such as osteosarcoma)?
- (iii) Due to shoulder instability?
- (iv) Related to the soft tissues (e.g. rotator cuff, bursa)?
- (v) Due to combinations of the above?

In addition to this, clinicians need to; exclude serious pathology, consider pain mechanisms, determine the relationship and influence of other co-morbidities, and discern the contribution from often profound, obscured and interwoven psychosocial factors. The process is complicated and becomes more so with the emergence of new research information from a multitude of specialties, which is frequently incomplete, and often contradictory.

The purpose of this Masterclass is to focus on one musculoskeletal shoulder problem, rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP), and discuss; function, pain, aetiology, imaging, surgery, assessment and management.

# 2. Rotator cuff function

The rotator cuff (RC) muscles and tendons are commonly considered to be recruited synchronously and equally to dynamically stabilise the humeral head onto the glenoid fossa during shoulder movement. This precept has been challenged and laboratory data suggest that the supra- and infraspinatus are recruited preferentially during shoulder flexion and subscapularis is recruited at higher levels during extension. Higher supra- and infraspinatus activation during shoulder flexion may contribute to reducing anterior glide of the humeral head during activities involving shoulder flexion, and subscapularis activity to reducing posterior glide during extension (Wattanaprakornkul et al., 2011). This asynchronous activity may potentially be used to inform exercise prescription. In addition, in higher ranges of shoulder elevation, such as unsupported abduction, the stabilising function of the cuff may be replaced by the deltoid which may be better oriented to stabilise the humeral head onto the glenoid fossa while allowing the RC to externally and internally rotate the glenohumeral joint (Boettcher et al., 2010). In addition, the belief that supraspinatus initiates abduction appears to be incorrect (Reed et al., 2013).

Clinically, rotator cuff tests have been developed to assess each of the individual tendons by placing the shoulder into defined positions and applying a force to the arm requiring the muscle tissue to contract (Magee, 2014). However the design of the RC does not permit the assessment of an individual musculotendinous unit. The tendons of the RC fuse into one structure, with the supraspinatus and infraspinatus fusing inseparably near their insertion. The muscular portion of teres minor and infraspinatus also fuse inseparably just proximal to the musculotendinous junction. The subscapularis and supraspinatus tendons fuse to form a sheath that surrounds the biceps tendon, and the RC tendons are tightly adherent to the glenohumeral joint capsule (Clark et al., 1990; Clark and Harryman, 1992). Although the interwoven nature of RC, capsule and ligament tissue would improve resistance to failure under load, it negates the possibility of testing individual structural units. The inability to test the RC musculotendinous units in isolation is further evidenced in electromyography, which has demonstrated that during the 'full' and 'empty' can tests designed to implicate supraspinatus pathology, eight to nine other muscles are equally active (Boettcher et al., 2009).

# 3. Rotator cuff related shoulder pain

RCRSP refers to the clinical presentation of pain and impairment of shoulder movement and function usually experienced during shoulder elevation and external rotation. Although numerous factors including; genetics (Harvie et al., 2004), hormonal influences (Magnusson et al., 2007), lifestyle factors such as smoking (Baumgarten et al., 2010) alcohol consumption (Passaretti et al., 2015), comorbidities and level of education (Dunn et al., 2014), biochemical, patho-anatomical, peripheral and central sensitisation, sensory-motor cortex changes (Lewis et al., 2015) and a raft of psychosocial factors (Dean and Soderlund, 2015) have the potential to contribute to RCRSP, excessive and mal-adaptive load imposed on the tissues appears to be a major influence (McCreesh and Lewis, 2013; Cook et al., 2015).

On-going debate persists pertaining to; (i) the cause of RCRSP, (ii) the mechanism(s) responsible for the sensation of pain, (iii) the relationship between symptoms and structural failure observed within the RC tendons, and (iv) the role and extent of inflammation (Lewis, 2009a, 2011, 2015; Seitz et al., 2011; Lewis and Ginn, 2015; Scott et al., 2015). These symptoms are commonly termed RC tendinopathy which implicates the tendon as the source of symptoms.

# 4. Aetiology

With respect to mechanism, Neer (1972, 1983) argued that 95% of all RC pathology occurred as a result of irritation onto the sub-acromial bursa and rotator cuff tendons from the under-surface of the over-lying anterior aspect of the acromion calling the condition; subacromial impingement syndrome. This hypothesis has also been embraced by physiotherapists (Grimsby and Gray, 1997). Once diagnosed, Neer (1983) recommended 12 months of non-surgical treatment for those aged over 40 years with persistent and disabling symptoms, and advocated that if non-surgical treatment was unsuccessful, a subacromial decompression (SAD), also known as an acromioplasty, should be considered. This operation has become one of the most commonly performed musculoskeletal surgical procedures, with a reported 746% increase in the number of SADs in England from 2001 to 2010 (Judge et al., 2014). In England and the USA there has been a concurrent increase in RC repairs. In the USA there was a 141% increase in RC repairs between 1996 and 2006 and embedded within this figure is a 600% increase in repairs performed arthroscopically (Colvin et al., 2012). The reasons for this are uncertain as arthroscopic repairs have been associated with; longer operating theatre times, a higher re-tear rate (46.4%) than open repairs (38.6%) and clinically with no significant difference in outcome (Carr et al., 2015).

The relevance of the acromion to the development of symptoms and RC tears also remains uncertain. The argument that acromial irritation leads to RC pathology is not supported by observational studies. Payne et al. (1997) reported 91% (39/43) of RC tears occurred on the inferior (articular or joint) side of the tendon with only 9% (n = 4) occurring on the bursal side (i.e. the side under the acromion). Fukuda et al. (1987) reported that 82% (n = 27) of tears were joint side or intratendinous and 28% (n = 6) were located on the bursal side. Ellman (1990) reported that from a total of 126 intra-operative investigations of the rotator cuff, 76% (n = 96) were found to have articular side tears, 14% (n = 17) bursal side, and 10% (n = 13) had both. This repeated and consistent finding that tears are predominantly located within the tendon or on the articular side does not support the acromial impingement model. Of relevance, already in 1934, Codman identified articular side tears calling them 'rim rents', stating; '…I am confident that these rim rents account for the majority of sore shoulders. It is my unproved opinion that many of these lesions never heal, although the symptoms caused by them usually disappear within a few months'. In reality, whether these tears cause pain or not, has never been established.

Observed variations in RC morphology may explain some of these findings. Hashimoto et al. (2003) reported greater fibre degeneration and disorientation in the middle and deeper fibres of the RC and argued that degeneration was the primary cause of RC tears. Nakajima et al. (1994) reported that the deeper fibres of the RC had a relatively smaller cross-sectional area than the articular side fibres and the lower fibres failed at approximately half the tensile load of those located superiorly. Bey et al. (2002) reported strain within the supraspinatus tendon that increased with increasing joint elevation between 15° and 60° abduction with no significant difference in strain between the upper and lower fibres.

As the lower fibres are relatively weaker, the suggestion is that the joint-side fibres are more vulnerable to a tensile load than the bursal-side fibres (Nakajima et al., 1994) during shoulder elevation and as such maybe more susceptible to failure and this may be independent of acromion irritation. Bigliani et al. (1986) described three distinct acromial shapes (flat, curved and hooked) attributing the differences to morphological variations and argued those with a Type III or hooked acromion would be more likely to experience subacromial pain symptoms and suffer a RC tear. Definitive causation has not been established and there appears to be a poor correlation between acromial shape and symptoms (Gill et al., 2002; Worland et al., 2003; Snow et al., 2009) further challenging the acromial model of RC tendinopathy. In addition, if the acromion is the cause for impingement and this eventuates in RC tears, a SAD should halt this process. This hypothesis has been disputed in studies that have demonstrated that a SAD provides no clinically important effect over a structured and supervised exercise program (Ketola et al., 2013), and others reporting the development of RC tears following an acromioplasty for people diagnosed with impingement syndrome (Hyvonen et al., 1998). Additionally, contact between the acromion and RC has been investigated (Chang et al., 2006) with reconstructed magnetic resonance (MR) images challenging the construct that osseous impingement by the acromion is the primary cause of subacromial impingement syndrome and RC tears. If comparable clinical improvement can be achieved with an exercise program without performing a SAD, and if RC tears occur following an acromioplasty, the hypotheses supporting the acromial impingement model are substantively challenged. These issues have been previously discussed in detail (Lewis, 2011; Lewis et al., 2015). The importance of the acromion is further challenged. Henkus et al. (2009) randomised 57 people with subacromial impingement syndrome to acromioplasty and bursectomy or bursectomy alone. At a mean 2.5 year follow up both groups reported comparable results with no significant difference in Constant score, Simple Shoulder test, and visual analogue scores for pain and function. They argued their results supported an intrinsic degenerative model for RC pathology rather than an extrinsic irritation model. Detailed descriptions of normal tendon composition, structure and function, and changes associated with tendinopathy have been published (Cook and Purdam, 2009; Lewis, 2009a, 2010; McCreesh and Lewis, 2013; Cook et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2015; Screen, 2015).

Osteophytes have been observed on the acromial but not the coracoid side of the coracoacromial ligament (Edelson and Taitz, 1992). The development of osteophytic spurs may be a secondary phenomenon (Chambler et al., 2003a) resulting from increased tension in the coracoacromial ligament as the arm is abducted (Chambler et al., 2003b). As the coracoacromial ligament is more trapezoid in shape, the smaller area of insertion on the acromial side may account for relative increase in tension and be the mechanism stimulating osteophyte growth at this location. If this hypothesis is correct then the Type II (curved) and Type III (hooked) acromion (Bigliani et al., 1986, 1991) may not be morphological variants, but may result from strain in the coracoacromial ligament disproportionally affecting the relatively smaller area of insertion on the acromial side. Chronic strain under the coracoacromial ligament may result from increases in RC tendon volume with significant differences being demonstrated in people diagnosed with RC tendinopathy (McCreesh et al., 2014) as well as RC fatigue or failure leading to superior translation of the humeral head during arm elevation (Mura et al., 2003). The coracoacromial ligament is a potential source of symptoms for people diagnosed with RCRSP with significant increases in nociceptive nerve fibres identified in this structure in this patient group (Tamai et al., 2000). As a causal relationship between acromial shape, acromial irritation and rotator cuff pathology has not been demonstrated, clinicians in discussion with patients should not implicate the acromion as the cause of RC tears or symptoms, and the term ‘impingement’ may create an incorrect perception of pathogenesis.

#  5. Relationship between imaging and symptoms

Clinical diagnoses are established through discussion with patients and clinical assessment procedures that may be supported by imaging studies and laboratory investigations (Hegedus et al., 2015; Hegedus and Lewis, 2015; Lewis et al., in press). The reliance on imaging may be problematic, with investigations reporting substantial numbers of people without symptoms demonstrating RC structural failure (Table 1) (Milgrom et al., 1995; Sher et al., 1995; Frost et al., 1999; Girish et al., 2011).

These findings have profound clinical implications. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios for clinical tests are based on gold standard reference tests that have identified structural failure and these findings are then compared with the responses produced using special orthopaedic tests such as the battery of rotator cuff tests and tests for impingement. The gold standard tests are generally considered to include; US, MRI and direct observation during surgery. However, the substantial numbers of people without symptoms who demonstrate structural failure largely invalidates US, MRI and direct intra-operative observation as gold standard reference tests. In addition, these findings also invalidate the majority of special orthopaedic tests and combinations of these tests as procedures to definitively rule in the structure that is causing the patient's symptoms. If anything, these tests should be considered as symptom provocation procedures (Lewis, 2009b).

The implication of a lack of a real ‘gold-standard’ comparator is that many people with shoulder symptoms who are given a structural diagnosis based on clinical orthopaedic tests and/or imaging procedures will be given incorrect diagnoses. A further implication is that patients will be listed for and undergo surgical operations on tissues that are not related and not the cause of their symptoms. It is unlikely a patient would agree to start insulin injections based on considerable inaccuracies in the diagnostic tests for diabetes, yet current clinical practice suggests that this may not be the case for many orthopaedic surgical procedures and musculoskeletal treatments.

#  6. Additional uncertainties associated with surgery

Success rates (good to excellent results) of up to 70e90% following SAD have been reported (Ellman and Kay, 1991; Spangehl et al., 2002). Following surgery there is an extended period of reduced activity and graduated return to function that might take many months. Post-operative protocols typically dictate very slow and gentle movements in the early stages of rehabilitation, with the avoidance of active shoulder movement if the RC has been repaired. Following SAD, studies from Australia and the United Kingdom, have reported that non-manual workers take up to an average of 6 weeks and manual workers up to an average of 3 months to return to work with an avoidance of driving for up to 4 weeks (McClelland et al., 2005; Charalambous et al., 2010). A relative reduction in tissue loading (relative rest) is frequently recommended in the early stages of treating a tendinopathy (Lewis, 2010, 2014; Cook et al., 2015). The relative rest and graduated rehabilitation imposed by the surgery may be the reason for improvement in symptoms and not the surgery itself (Lewis, 2011, 2015). This hypothesis needs to be tested in an appropriately designed investigation, but until it has, surgeons need to be circumspect with their explanation of the intended benefits of SAD and RC repairs to those

Findings from imaging studies which challenge pe reliance on imaging to determine pe cause of symptoms.
• In a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, Sher et al. (1995) reported pat 54% of people over pe age of 60 years wipout shoulder symptoms demonstrated a partial (PTT) or full pickness RC tear (FTT).
• Milgrom et al. (1995) in an ultrasound investigation (US) reported pat pe incidence of RC tears increased wip age and PTT and FTT were present in pe dominant shoulder of 50% of people wipout any shoulder symptoms in peir 7p decade and in 80% in pose aged over 80 years.
• The baseball pitch requires considerable precision and places substantial challenges on pe shoulder. From pe cocking position pe shoulder moves 80° in 30 msec generating peak shoulder internal rotation velocities between 6000 and 7000°/sec, and following ball release pe shoulder decelerates from pese speeds to cessation of movement wipin 50 msec (Pappas et al., 1985; Feltner, 1986; Dillman et al., 1993; Fleisig et al., 1999). Ball speeds have been reported to reach 170 km/h. MRI findings in asymptomatic professional baseball pitchers have demonstrated; RC abnormalities in pe prowing shoulder (79%) and non-prowing shoulder (86%) and labral abnormities (79%) in bop shoulders (Miniaci et al., 2002).
• In asymptomatic elite level overhead apletes (pitchers and tennis players), 40% were found to have PTT and FTT of pe RC on peir dominant side, and when followed up after 5 years none had reported any symptoms or had required treatment, leading pe aupors to conclude pat MRI alone should not be used as pe basis for operative intervention (Connor et al., 2003).
• Frost et al. (1999) reported pat in an MRI investigation, an equivalent percentage of people wip subacromial impingement (55%) and pose wipout shoulder symptoms (52%) had RC papology. The prevalence of RC papology increased wip age and pe papology observed in pe MRI did not correlate wip symptoms.
• Girish et al. (2011) using US, reported pat shoulder abnormalities including; subacromial bursal pickening, supraspinatus tendinosis and tears, and glenoid labral abnormalities, were identified in 96% of men who did not have shoulder symptoms. The relationship between bursal pickening and symptoms has been challenged (Daghir et al., 2012; Couanis et al., 2015), wip pe possible exception of a substantial single endurance event (21 km swim) (Couanis et al., 2015).

# Assessment and the Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure

Assessment involves taking a detailed history and discussion with the patient, screening and on-going monitoring for potential red-flag presentations, functional/disability questionnaires, assessment of impairment that may include; range of movement, strength, posterior capsule extensibility, neural tests, pain behavior, etc. Increasing and decreasing load on the muscle tendon-unit may also help to support clinical hypotheses. Orthopaedic tests and imaging may support the clinical examination. However, as discussed the value of orthopaedic tests may be no more than symptom reproduction and clinical reasoning to implicate the structure(s) based on these tests has been challenged (Lewis, 2009b).

Narrative and systematic reviews have challenged the extent to which a definitive structural diagnosis is achievable (Hegedus et al., 2012; Hegedus and Lewis, 2015). In response to this, suggestions have been presented to use symptom modification (also known as treatment direction test/treatment classification tests/improvement test) as a method to inform clinical management (Lewis et al., in press; Lewis, 2009b; Lewis et al., 2015).

One such approach is the Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure (SSMP) first described in 2009 (Lewis, 2009b). The SSMP systematically investigates the influence of thoracic posture, three planes of scapular posture (and combinations of scapular positioning), and humeral head position (using a battery of tests) on shoulder symptoms. SSMP assessment techniques found to reduce symptoms are then used to treat the symptoms. If the first three stages of the SSMP do not completely alleviate or reduce symptoms, then the final stage of the SSMP involves assessing the influence of manual therapy procedures throughout the cervical, thoracic, and shoulder regions that may modulate shoulder symptoms. The process has been presented and discussed in detail elsewhere (Lewis et al., in press; Lewis, 2009b; Lewis et al., 2015).

# Exercise therapy

Although a structured exercise program is unequivocally the main intervention for RCRSP (Haahr and Andersen, 2006; Ketola et al., 2013; Kukkonen et al., 2014) consensus on dosage, frequency, method of delivery, acceptable pain tolerance, inter-exercise activity levels, and specific exercise inclusion has not been achieved. Systematic reviews investigating exercise for RCRSP have produced varied findings.

Desmeules et al. (2003) reported limited evidence to support the efficacy of therapeutic exercise and manual therapy. Kromer et al. (2009) reported equal effectiveness of physiotherapist-led exercises compared with surgery in the long term. Kuhn (2009) concluded that; exercise had statistically and clinically significant

Effects on pain reduction and improving function, but not on range of motion or strengp, and manual perapy may augment pe effects of exercise. In pis review home exercise programs were found to be as beneficial as supervised exercises. Braun and Hanchard (2010) reported limited support for manual perapy and exercise of short to medium term effectiveness, and highlighted mepodological flaws and risk of bias in many of pe included studies.

# Fig. 1. SSMP (Stage 1). Example: Assessment of influence of thoracic kyphosis.

Kelly et al. (2010) reported only limited evidence was found to support the use of exercise, whereas, Hanratty et al. (2012) concluded that; strong evidence existed for exercise to decrease pain and improve function in the short-term, and moderate level evidence suggested that exercise resulted in short-term improvement in mental well-being and long-term improvement in function. They also concluded that synthesis of definitive exercise prescription to achieve these benefits was indeterminable due to poor reporting of protocols. Abdulla et al. (2015) reported that; supervised and home based strengthening (and stretching) may lead to short term benefit in pain and disability, and that for persistent symptoms exercise leads to similar outcomes as surgery.

the management of other musculoskeletal problems, such as fractures. A person with a fracture not demonstrating clinical and radiological union involving the upper arm or forearm would be unable to perform certain activities such as; serving in tennis, hammering nails into walls and would need to make certain compromises with respect to the fracture. Frequently tendon related problems are harder to treat and follow a more protracted course than fractures and the requirement to adhere to appropriate levels of activity is necessary. Managing a tendon related problem should not be seen as only treating a local problem and attention to wider issues, including lifestyle factors, are essential (Dean and S€oderlund, 2015). Providing a local shoulder based treatment in isolation maybe an ineffective management strategy in the management of RCRSP. Clinicians and patients need to appreciate that many activities involving the shoulder require that energy is transferred from the lower to upper limbs through the trunk and an inability to transfer energy from the lower limbs may result in increased demands on the shoulder (Kibler, 1995; Kibler and Chandler, 1995; Seroyer et al., 2010; Sciascia and Cromwell, 2012), potentially leading to local overload and local symptoms. This is easy to appreciate and the clinician can facilitate this by asking the patient to describe how they would throw a ball, serve in tennis or perform some other similar activity. Although currently there is no definite clinical method of identifying the impact that; movement restriction, pain, fatigue in the lower limbs and trunk has on the shoulder, clinicians should consider including exercise and appropriate management for these regions commensurate with the patient's level of function and functional requirements. Sensory-motor exercises appropriate for the patient's level of function may also enhance outcome.

These differences in reported findings may relate to different; diagnostic categories, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality assessment tools, and methods used within each review. Ideally treatment intervention would result in complete resolution of symptoms and in a Numbers Needed to Treat of 1 (Sackett et al., 2000; Greenhalgh et al., 2014), where everyone receiving an appropriate intervention reports a favourable outcome when compared to a control group. Unfortunately this is not the case. There are many possible reasons for this including; incomplete knowledge of the source and mechanism(s) of symptoms and inadequate and appropriate treatments to address these factors. Other factors include psychosocial influences, duration of symptoms, genetics, comorbidities, lifestyle issues and hormonal status. Inadequate and/or inappropriate provision of treatment will also influence outcome. One possible reason for suboptimal outcome is not stratifying intervention according to clinical presentation as has been suggested in other musculoskeletal conditions (O'Sullivan, 2005). As detailed in Fig. 6, one method of stratifying management for RCRSP is to sub-categorise the clinical presentation into irritable, non-irritable and advanced. Overlap in management strategies exist between these sub-categories.

# 9. Management of rotator cuff related shoulder pain

Common to all clinical presentations is the need to engage with the individual experiencing the symptoms, allowing the person to voice their needs and concerns. Understanding and acknowledgement of the impact of the problem demonstrates empathy. In addition, patients should be given the opportunity to discuss their understanding of the cause of the symptoms, how quickly they expect to recover, the treatments they may consider to be effective, and, their thoughts on the treatment the clinician recommends. Clinicians should provide information relating to cause, prognosis and expected outcome and avoid ‘threatening’ language such as ‘acromion impinging and wearing away or tearing into the tendon’. Patients need to understand that the management of tendon related problems requires at least the same respect as afforded to other musculoskeletal problems.

Steroidal anti-inflammatories have been associated with myocardial infarction and stroke, with the risk increasing even after several weeks of use. In addition, corticosteroids have been associated with deleterious effects on rotator cuff tissue (Dean et al., 2014a, 2014b). Although there is a worrying paucity of evidence to support injection therapy for the shoulder, studies that have compared analgesic only injections to corticosteroid and analgesic injections have reported comparable outcomes up to 6 months (Akgun et al., 2004; Alvarez et al., 2005) and due to the local and systemic risks associated with corticosteroids, analgesic only injections, although not without risk, could possibly be considered as first line injection management. One possible reason for this is that both glucocorticoids and local anaesthetics appear to be able to reduce tenocyte numbers (Scherb et al., 2009; Carofino et al., 2012). Tenocyte proliferation has been associated with tendinopathy (Scott et al., 2015; Screen, 2015) and one possibility is that injection therapy may contribute to restoration of tendon cellular homeostasis by reducing tenocyte numbers. This hypothesis requires appropriate scrutiny. Injection therapy may help reduce pain to permit

Generic general principles:

- Education
- Relative rest

- Address associated impairments
- Motor control
- Graduated re-loading
- Whole of body rehabilitation

Clinical presentations:

Symptoms (commonly): Pain and reduced function

Non-irritable

Non-irritable RCRSP may benefit from a graduated shoulder flexion program such as described in Fig. 7 and progresses to short lever (i.e. elbow bent) shoulder flexion initially without, then with, increasing weights and resistances. Free weights may be used.
---
# Advanced RCRSP

End stage or advanced RCRSP is characterised by massive and inoperable RC tears. These tears are frequently (but not always) associated with substantial morbidity and represent a clinical challenge for physiotherapists. As these tears are generally unrepairable, surgeons may recommend joint replacement surgery (Harreld et al., 2012). The findings of a randomised controlled clinical trial (Ainsworth et al., 2009) suggested that an exercise program specifically designed for this clinical presentation demonstrated significant benefit at three and six months. This program may be enhanced by SSMP techniques and exercises described in the irritable and non-irritable RCRPS stages, including the exercises depicted in Fig. 7.

Although there are many reasons for suboptimal outcomes, people with RCRPS should derive considerable confidence from the research literature that they should achieve at least comparable results as they would if undergoing surgery for RCRSP (Haahr et al., 2005; Haahr and Andersen, 2006; Ketola et al., 2009, 2013), and, atraumatic partial thickness tears (Kukkonen et al., 2014). This extends to people diagnosed with atraumatic full thickness tears (Kuhn et al., 2013) as well as those diagnosed with RCRSP who have previously failed non-surgical treatment (Hallgren et al., 2014).

ABSTRACT

Lateral ankle sprain injury is the most common musculoskeletal injury incurred by individuals who participate in sports and recreational physical activities. Following initial injury, a high proportion of individuals develop long-term injury-associated symptoms and chronic ankle instability. The development of chronic ankle instability is consequent on the interaction of mechanical and sensorimotor insufficiencies/impairments that manifest following acute lateral ankle sprain injury. To reduce the propensity for developing chronic ankle instability, clinical assessments should evaluate whether patients in the acute phase following lateral ankle sprain injury exhibit any mechanical and/or sensorimotor impairments. This modified Delphi study was undertaken under the auspices of the executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium. The primary aim was to develop recommendations, based on expert (n=14) consensus, for structured clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. After two modified Delphi rounds, consensus was achieved on the clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. Consensus was reached on a minimum standard clinical diagnostic assessment. Key components of this clinical diagnostic assessment include: establishing the mechanism of injury, as well as the assessment of ankle joint bones and ligaments. Through consensus, the expert panel also developed the International Ankle Consortium Rehabilitation-Oriented ASsessmenT (ROAST). The International Ankle Consortium ROAST will help clinicians identify mechanical and/or sensorimotor impairments that are associated with chronic ankle instability. This consensus statement from the International Ankle Consortium aims to be a key resource for clinicians who regularly assess individuals with acute lateral ankle sprain injuries.

INTRODUCTION

Lateral ankle sprains are the most common lower limb musculoskeletal injury incurred by individuals who participate in sports and recreational physical activities. The prevalence of lateral ankle sprains among the general population is also substantial, as demonstrated by hospital emergency department data. Up to 70% of the general population report having incurred an ankle injury during their lifetime.

Lateral ankle sprain injuries associate with high societal economic costs, related to injury diagnosis, initial management, rehabilitation and reported reduced work productivity. In the UK, Cooke et al reported an average of 6.9 days of paid work lost due to lateral ankle sprain injuries, adding at least an additional £805 in lost productivity costs for each injury to the overall costs, compared with £135 of direct healthcare costs. The combination of high incidence and both direct and indirect costs makes the economic burden of lateral ankle sprain injuries indisputable.

Lateral ankle sprain injuries have the highest reinjury rate of all lower limb musculoskeletal injuries. Individuals who incur an acute lateral ankle sprain injury have a twofold increased risk of reinjury in the year following their initial injury. Reinjury coincides with the progression of a number of chronic injury-associated sequelae including: pain, persistent swelling, feelings of ankle joint instability, ankle joint 'giving-way', recurrent injury and reduced functional capacity as illustrated by reduced scores on patient-reported outcome measures questionnaires. These injury-associated sequelae constitute the characteristic features of chronic ankle instability. High reinjury rates might be due to inadequate rehabilitation, and/or premature return to sport. Hence, reducing the risk of reinjury and the propensity for the development of chronic ankle instability is a key priority after acute lateral ankle sprain injury occurrence.

The interaction of mechanical and sensorimotor impairments that manifest following acute lateral ankle sprain injury contribute to the development of chronic ankle instability. Therefore, clinical assessments should evaluate whether a patient in the acute phase following lateral ankle sprain injury exhibits any mechanical and/or sensorimotor impairments. However, previous research has documented that clinicians may have a limited understanding of the full spectrum of mechanical and sensorimotor impairments that manifest following an acute lateral ankle sprain injury. Hence, the

treatment being administered following acute lateral ankle sprain Likert scale) responses was calculated. Consensus agreement was Br J Sports Med: first published as 10.1136/bjsports-2017-098885 on 9 June 2018. Downloaded from injury is unlikely to be based on objectively identified mechanical and sensorimotor impairments. As such, it is necessary to develop recommendations for structured clinical assessment following acute lateral ankle sprain injury, which addresses both mechanical and sensorimotor impairments. Considering this, the aim of this project was to develop, based on expert consensus, recommendations for structured clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. These recommendations should have a particular emphasis on impairments that are known to associate with chronic ankle instability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

This modified (consisting of two rounds) Delphi study was undertaken under the auspices of the executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium. The International Ankle Consortium, which was inaugurated in 2004, is an international community of researchers and clinicians whose primary academic purpose is to promote scholarship and dissemination of research-informed knowledge related to ankle sprain injury and chronic ankle instability. A previous consensus statement of the International Ankle Consortium2 and its supporting evidence document1 were used as the starting point for this modified Delphi study. The protocol for the present modified Delphi study, which details the study methodology, has been published.18 In summary, our modified Delphi process started with an anonymous online questionnaire (round 1) specifically related to the clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. The online questionnaire consisted of a number of distinct sections including: (1) participant demographics; (2) subjective assessment and patient-reported outcome measures; (3) diagnostic imaging; (4) objective assessment (including assessment of bony integrity, ligamentous integrity, range of motion, arthrokinematics, strength, neurodynamics and postural balance); and (5) performance assessment. An email was sent to all members of the executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium requesting their participation in the online questionnaire. Participants were required to complete the online questionnaire within 4 weeks of receiving the invitation email. A reminder email was sent to all participants 2 weeks after the initial invitation email. Regarding the online questionnaire, participants were requested to respond to questions related to the importance of different constructs of the clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries on a scale of 1–5 (1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 3=no opinion; 4=agree; and 5=strongly agree). They also had the opportunity to elaborate further on how they would assess certain structures or functions by providing expanded answers to open-ended questions. The responses to the online questionnaire were collated, analysed (completed August 2017) and used as the foundation for a subsequent consensus meeting of the executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium (ie, international multidisciplinary expert group). This consensus meeting (held on 14 September 2017) represented round 2 of this modified Delphi method.

RESULTS

After two consecutive modified Delphi rounds, performed between May 2017 and September 2017, full consensus was achieved on the clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries (figure 1 and table 1).

Expert panel

Fourteen experts from the executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium were invited to participate, all of who agreed. The expert panel (males=84.6%, females=15.4%; age=45±6.2 years) were employed in a number of countries including Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, USA and the UK. All expert panel members had authored or coauthored numerous peer-reviewed articles on the topics of lateral ankle sprain and chronic ankle instability, as well as having contributed to previous consensus statements. The years of clinical experience varied (15.7±13.5 years) across the members. The expert panel members assessed an average of 40 patients a year with lateral ankle sprain injuries and/or chronic ankle instability. The expert panel members identified their expertise in the clinical assessment of patients with acute lateral ankle sprain injuries and/or chronic ankle instability as an average of 8 out of 10, with 10 being the highest level of expertise.

Delphi round 1

All experts (100%) participated in round 1; however, answers for one participant were excluded due to technical issues. Thirteen participants successfully completed round 1. Expert consensus (≥75% agreement) was reached on 37 of the 62 questions included in the online questionnaire. Fifteen criteria reached partial agreement (50%–75%) and hence were brought forward for discussion in round 2. Online supplementary file table 1 details the level of agreement for each of the questions in the online questionnaire.

Delphi round 2

Ten of the 14 expert panel members were able to attend the executive committee meeting of the International Ankle Consortium, which functioned as round 2 of the modified Delphi process. This meeting took place the day before the 7th International Ankle Symposium (14 September 2017). Results from round 1, which reached ≥75% agreement, were automatically included in this consensus. Results from round 1 that reached partial agreement (50%–75%) along with responses to open-ended questions (part of the online questionnaire) were discussed further among the 10 experts who were present at round 2. To establish the level of agreement in round 2, the total percentage of ‘strongly agree’ (5 on the Likert scale) and ‘agree’ (4 on the Likert scale) responses was calculated. Consensus agreement was defined as ≥75%. Final consensus was reached in round 2 and is presented in figure 1 and table 1.

Consensus on recommendations for clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. With regard to injury diagnosis, there were five important considerations, which the expert panel reached consensus on. These are as follows: (1) mechanism of injury; (2) history of previous lateral ankle sprain; (3) weight-bearing status; (4) clinical assessment of bones; and (5) clinical assessment of ligaments. Hence, the experts agreed that these should be clustered into a clinical diagnostic assessment. Regarding the evaluation of mechanical and sensorimotor impairments, there were 10 important considerations, which the expert panel reached consensus on. These are as follows: (1) pain; (2) swelling; (3) range of motion; (4) arthrokinematics; (5)

# Consensus statement

muscle strength; (6) static postural balance; (7) dynamic postural ankle joint X-ray is warranted (online supplementary appendix Br J Sports Med: first published as 10.1136/bjsports-2017-098885 on 9 June 2018. Downloaded from balance; (8) gait; (9) physical activity level; and (10) patient-re- I). The Ottawa Ankle Rules have been reported to have higher sensitivity than specificity, meaning that they are better at ruling out the possibility of ankle joint fracture, rather than making a diagnosis of ankle joint fracture.

Following an inversion and internal rotation injury of the ankle joint, the pretest probability of ankle joint fracture is less than 15%.

If the Ottawa Ankle Rules are implemented in such instances but findings are negative (ie, none of the rules are positive; negative likelihood ratio=0.02), the post-test probability of ankle joint fracture is less than 1%.

# Clinical diagnostic assessment

The expert panel agreed on a pragmatic minimum standard clinical diagnostic assessment, which does not require specialist equipment (eg, diagnostic imaging) and can be applied across a range of clinical settings.

# Mechanism of injury

Establishing the mechanism of injury is advocated as it can give clinicians an indication of what anatomical structures are likely to have incurred insult, and hence what tissues should be prioritised during clinical assessment. Numerous published articles have described the kinematics of lateral ankle sprain injury occurrences. Clinicians should suspect injury to the lateral ligaments of the ankle joint if the patient reports that the mechanism of injury involved a sudden rapid inversion and internal rotation loading of the foot and ankle complex, irrespective of sagittal plane angular displacement. The mechanisms of injury associated with ankle syndesmosis ligament injuries are less clear but have been reported to include external rotation of the foot, eversion of the talus within the ankle mortise and excessive dorsiflexion. Therefore, clinicians should suspect injury to the syndesmosis ligaments if the patient describes/recalls any of the aforementioned injury mechanisms (ie, external rotation of the foot and hyperdorsiflexion).

# History of previous lateral ankle sprain

Establishing history of previous lateral ankle sprain injury or ankle joint injury is endorsed primarily for two reasons. First, it has been established that previous lateral ankle sprain injury heightens the risk of injury recurrence. Second, if the presenting patient has previously sustained a lateral ankle sprain injury, it is probable that injury-associated mechanical and sensorimotor impairments are present, which should be addressed as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation programme.

# Weight-bearing status

Weight-bearing status should be established, both via subjective reporting related to the time of injury and during clinical presentation in accordance with the Ottawa Ankle Rules. An inability to weight-bear four steps immediately after injury and on clinical presentation should alert clinicians to the possibility of ankle joint fracture. The likelihood of ankle joint fracture can be established with high sensitivity by using the Ottawa Ankle Rules, whereby weight-bearing status and clinical assessment of the 'malleolar zone' are combined in a clinical prediction rule.

# Clinical assessment of bones

The Ottawa Ankle Rules should be used to determine the likelihood of ankle joint fracture. If a patient reports pain in the 'malleolar zone' and if this is accompanied by pain on palpation of the distal 6 cm of the posterior edge of the medial malleolus, or pain on palpation of the distal 6 cm of the posterior edge of the lateral malleolus, or an inability to weight-bear four steps immediately after injury and on clinical presentation, then an ankle joint X-ray is warranted.

# Clinical assessment of ligaments

The clinical assessment of the integrity of the lateral ligaments of the ankle joint, as well as the ankle joint syndesmosis ligaments is advocated. The main lateral ligamentous stabilisers of the ankle joint are: the anterior talofibular ligament, the calcaneofibular ligament and the posterior talofibular ligament. The anterior talofibular ligament is the most commonly injured of these ligaments. It originates at the anterior margin of the lateral malleolus, and it runs anteromedially to insert on the talar body immediately anterior to the joint surface occupied by the lateral malleolus.

# Consensus statement

determine the true presence of these impairments in the acute stiffness, resulting in dynamic protection of joints. A strength deficit of the ankle musculature could compromise the integrity of the ankle joint to withstand sudden injurious movements. Individuals with chronic ankle instability have been reported to exhibit deficits in ankle joint strength. Muscle strength can be measured objectively using isokinetic dynamometers and handheld dynamometers. A hand-held dynamometer offers a practical, clinically applicable alternative to isokinetic dynamometry due to its portability, reduced cost and convenient size. Ankle joint strength can be measured in an objective and reliable manner using hand-held dynamometry (online supplementary appendix I). Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that hip strength may be an important factor to also consider, as research has identified proximal strength deficits in individuals with chronic ankle instability.

# Pain

Quantification of a patient’s current self-reported ankle joint pain is endorsed. Self-reported pain should be used as a clinically oriented outcome measure to guide the progression of exercise-based rehabilitation and to assess the efficacy of treatments implemented. Numerous options exist for assessing ankle joint pain in clinical settings. The numeric rating scale for pain is a valid and reliable scale to measure pain intensity. It can be administered both verbally and in writing and can be used to quantify pain during various activities. However, it only evaluates one component of the pain experience, namely, pain intensity. The assessment of ankle-specific pain is a central component of the Foot and Ankle Disability Index, which is a patient-reported outcome questionnaire designed to assess functional limitations related to foot and ankle conditions.

# Swelling

The assessment of ankle joint swelling is advocated. Ankle joint swelling may alter somatosensory input to the central nervous system which, through the process of arthrogenic muscle inhibition, could negatively affect functional joint stability. The quantification of ankle joint swelling should be used as a clinically oriented outcome measure to direct exercise-based rehabilitation progression and to measure the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The figure-of-eight method has been reported to be a valid and reliable clinically applicable method for indirectly quantifying ankle joint swelling (online supplementary appendix I).

# Range of motion

A comprehensive assessment of both passive and active ankle joint range of motion is endorsed. The quantification of ankle joint range of motion should be used as a clinically oriented outcome measure to guide exercise-based rehabilitation progression and to gauge the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Of particular concern following lateral ankle sprain injury is the propensity for the development of a restriction in ankle joint dorsiflexion range of motion. Sufficient ankle joint dorsiflexion range of motion is important as it has been reported to explain up to 28% of the variance in dynamic postural balance performance, as assessed via the anterior reach direction of the Star Excursion Balance Test. The weight-bearing lunge test is a clinically applicable, valid and reliable method for assessing ankle joint dorsiflexion range of motion (online supplementary appendix I).

# Arthrokinematics

Assessment of talocrural joint arthrokinematics is advocated. It has been proposed that impairments in ankle joint dorsiflexion range of motion are likely related to a disruption in talocrural arthrokinematics. This is supported by studies that have reported either restrictions in posterior talar glide, or the existence of an anterior positional fault of the talus within the talocrural joint. The posterior talar glide test as reported by Denegar et al can be used to assess posterior glide of the talus within the talocrural joint.

# Muscle strength

Assessment of ankle joint muscle strength is advocated. During the contractile process, musculotendinous units generate

Future research

High-quality prospective research is needed to determine whether these recommendations for clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries can optimize the management of individuals who have incurred this injury.

# CONCLUSION

The executive committee of the International Ankle Consortium reached consensus on recommendations for structured clinical assessment of acute lateral ankle sprain injuries. Recommendations are provided on an initial diagnostic clinical assessment. The International Ankle Consortium ROAST is also presented, which places emphasis on the assessment of mechanical and sensorimotor impairments that are known to associate with chronic ankle instability.

A healthy 19-year-old male college student (height ¼ 177.8 cm, mass ¼ 64.3 kg, body mass index ¼ 20.3 kg/m2, Foot Posture Index ¼ "1) participating in a study sustained a grade 2 inversion lateral ankle sprain 3 days after completing patient-reported outcome measures. A treatment protocol including therapeutic exercises and midfoot mobilizations was provided. Patient-reported outcomes assessing physical health, mental health, and foot-ankle function were completed 3 days preinjury and 1, 3, and 12 weeks postinjury. Substantial postinjury sprain

Lateral ankle sprains (LASs) are the most common injury in sports and frequently result in functional changes in function, physical health, and kinesiophobia reflected functional limitations that improved with treatment and time. This level 3 exploration case report provides a rare opportunity to highlight preinjury-to-postinjury changes in reported outcome measures. A treatment protocol including therapeutic exercises and midfoot mobilizations was provided. Patient-reported outcomes assessing physical health, mental health, and foot-ankle function were completed 3 days preinjury and 1, 3, and 12 weeks postinjury. Substantial postinjury sprain

The patient consented to participate in a research study approved by the university’s institutional review board investigating foot function in individuals with or without LAS or chronic ankle instability (CAI; National Institutes of Health NCT02697461). He met the criteria for inclusion in the healthy group: aged 18–50 years, participated in 20 minutes of physical activity at least thrice weekly, and had no history of ankle or foot sprain, leg or foot fracture, lower extremity disability, neurologic or vestibular deficit, diabetes mellitus, lumbosacral radiculopathy, or connective tissue disorder. The patient completed commonly used PROs that included the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)-ADL subscales, and Sport (IdFAI), Identification of Functional Ankle Instability Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Questionnaire, Global Health Questionnaire, and Godin Leisure-time Exercise Questionnaire. Global quality of life scores were calculated using previously described methods. Collection of clinical measures of ankle-foot function was scheduled for the following week.

The patient sustained a left grade 2 inversion LAS after stepping on an opponent’s foot during a basketball game 3 days before data collection as a healthy participant. He denied hearing or feeling a pop or crack at the time of injury but experienced immediate lateral ankle and foot pain and edema. He had limited mobility, self-medicated with over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed, and intermittently iced the joint to mitigate pain during the initial 36 hours after injury. The patient sought care at the university’s student health clinic 2 days postinjury after experiencing joint pain, stiffness, muscle weakness, and difficulty bearing weight.

He received axillary crutches from the clinic but left after becoming impatient before being seen by the primary care provider. The patient experienced substantial activity

Table 1. Preinjury Activity and Postinjury Disablement After Lateral Ankle Sprain

|Preinjury Activity|Functional Impairment|1-wk Postinjury Injury Limitation|Participation Restriction|
|---|---|---|---|
|Walking to class (approximately 5 mi/wk [8 km])|Pain|Walking (limited for 3 days)|Took longer to get to classes but was able to attend|
|Basketball (1–2 games/wk)|Lateral foot|Unable to run, cut, jump|Unable to play basketball with friends|
|Strength training (4–5 d/wk)|Lateral ankle Muscle weakness Fibularis longus/brevis, limited by pain Joint stiffness Talocrural articulation|Unable to perform rowing, lower extremity strengthening with weights|Unable to perform regular physical training program with partner|

The patient returned to the laboratory 3 weeks postinjury to receive the experimental intervention. Because midfoot hypomobility was present on reexamination, he was provided grade 4 joint mobilizations consisting of forefoot-on-rearfoot inversion with dorsal cuboid pressure and a first tarsometatarsal plantar glide performed for 30 seconds each.

Cavitation did not occur during the first bout of either intervention, so a second 30-second bout of mobilizations was provided. Home exercises were reviewed and corrected as needed. Self-reported compliance was 70% of the total volume, and he could demonstrate all home exercises using appropriate technique at the follow-up and final visits.

# Comparative Outcomes

Changes in PROs were assessed at 3 days preinjury and 1, 3, and 12 weeks postinjury. Changes were considered substantial if they exceeded the published minimal detectable change, which is the smallest measurement not attributed to error. Minimal detectable changes are useful when assessing change within individual patients across time points and are calculated using the standard error of measurement and intraclass correlation coefficient. A change in the IdFAI result was considered substantial if the score increased to .10 or decreased to. The patient was asked to rate his treatment response immediately from preinjury to postinjury and from preinjury to 1 week after the intervention using a single assessment.

numeric evaluation (SANE; "100% ¼ full exacerbation, 0 ¼ no change, 100% ¼ full resolution) and pe Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale.

The changes in PRO measures from preinjury to postinjury and during recovery are shown in Table 2. Substantial activity limitations in the FAAM-ADL and Sport, PROMIS Physical Composite, and IdFAI scores were observed after injury. Although his IdFAI score improved to a subclinical level after the 2-week intervention (3 weeks postinjury), a subsequent decline in function was observed at 12 weeks postinjury, indicative of increased perceived or episodic instability. Functional scores on these measures followed a similar trend of improvement after intervention that persisted until 12 weeks postinjury. Physical activity as reflected in the Godin Leisure-time Exercise Questionnaire score did not change from 3 days preinjury to 1 week postinjury.

However, measures of perception of injury and mental health changed after injury. Kinesiophobia, or fear of movement, increased substantially on the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) after injury. The TSK-11 score gradually improved at subsequent time points but did not exceed the minimal detectable change calculated from the reported measurement properties. The injury had no effect on the PROMIS Mental Health Composite score, yet a substantial improvement in mental health was observed from 3 days preinjury to 1 week posttreatment that persisted to 12 weeks postinjury. Predicted quality of life declined after injury, followed by incremental and progressive improvements through 12 weeks postinjury.

The patient reported no change in symptoms (GROC ¼ 0, about the same; SANE ¼ 0%) from immediately preinjury to postsham treatment during the initial study visit (1 week postinjury). A preinjury to 1-week improvement was reported (GROC ¼ 2, a slight bit better; SANE ¼ 25% improvement) after performing a 7-day HEP. The patient crossed over to receive the joint mobilizations during his follow-up visit (2 weeks postinjury) and reported immediate preinjury-to-postinjury improvement afterward (GROC ¼ 2, a slight bit better; SANE ¼ 25%) that persisted at 1 week posttreatment (3 weeks postinjury; GROC ¼ 2, a slight bit better; SANE ¼ 99%).

At 3 weeks postinjury, the patient reported substantial improvement in his symptoms; resumed basketball-specific tasks that did not require cutting, jumping, or pivoting; and restarted lower extremity weight training without difficulty. Persistent discomfort, stiffness, and perceived instability precluded him from running and cutting, which restricted his ability to participate in basketball games with his friends. The patient had resumed all functional activity without difficulty or limitation by 12 weeks postinjury.

# DISCUSSION

The primary findings of this exploration case report were that substantial changes in physical health, function, and kinesiophobia PROs reflected activity limitation after LAS. Activity and participation restrictions improved with treatment and time. This is the only case report, to our knowledge, to highlight preinjury-to-postinjury changes in patient-reported physical, psychological, and functional measures after LAS. These findings substantiate the clinical necessity of tracking multidimensional PROs when caring for patients after LAS. This case provides clinicians with an example of how physical and psychological function changed after injury and how PROs can be used to track treatment responses and functional outcomes throughout the rehabilitation course.

The patient reported difficulty walking; an inability to run, cut, or jump while playing basketball; and limitations when performing closed kinetic chain lower extremity strengthening due to ankle pain, stiffness, weakness, and feelings of instability after injury. Postinjury limitations and participation restrictions were reflected in changes in the IdFAI, FAAM-ADL and -Sports subscales, and PROMIS Physical Composite scores. These PROs measure physical function related to the ankle-foot complex or general health and accurately differentiate uninjured from injured individuals.

Our patient’s IdFAI score improved to a subclinical level (10) after treatment at 3 weeks postinjury but interestingly increased to 15 at 12 weeks postinjury.

Predicted score based on response to the PROMIS Global Health instrument.

Incremental and progressive improvements in functional measures of ADLs occurred, and these values returned to preinjury levels by the end of treatment. This finding is clinically important because the FAAM-ADL has been identified as a primary predictor of progression from LAS to CAI.

The FAAM-Sports subscale score improved to subclinical level by the end of treatment, but residual symptoms delayed restoration to the preinjury level until 12 weeks postinjury. Short-term improvements in functional PROs have previously been reported 4 weeks after LAS in response to natural recovery. How much recovery in this case could be attributed to natural recovery versus treatment response is unknown. Delayed intervention in this patient may limit the generalizability of the findings to the sports medicine clinic setting, where interventions may be applied earlier in the treatment course. Future study of the effects of manual therapy and therapeutic exercise for addressing the multiple segments of the ankle-foot complex on functional outcomes is warranted.

Predicted quality of life and kinesiophobia substantially worsened after injury and improved incrementally after treatment. The patient maintained a high level of quality of life and a subclinical level of kinesiophobia after injury, despite the substantial decline in function noted on the PROs. This was also evident in the unchanged Godin Leisure-time Exercise Questionnaire score after injury. The patient adapted to his injury by focusing on activities he could do in lieu of his normal routine. These factors likely indicate the patient’s ability to cope with his injury, his attitude toward injury, and his high levels of resiliency and self-efficacy. These psychological traits have been suggested to play important roles in injury recovery and return to sport.

When asked to qualify why there was no change in the activity questionnaire score, the patient explained that he capitalized on the opportunity to strengthen his upper extremities and uninjured limb. His positive attitude likely influenced compliance with treatment and the rate of recovery. This characteristic also likely explains the lack of change in the PROMIS Mental Health Composite score from preinjury to postinjury. Future research investigating the effects of clinician-led strategies promoting positive psychological attributes and mitigating detrimental factors after LAS is needed.

CLINICAL BOTTOM LINE

This patient presented a unique opportunity to evaluate preinjury-to-postinjury changes in PROs after LAS and in response to treatment and recovery. He demonstrated substantial changes in self-reported function during ADLs and sport, global physical health, and kinesiophobia that reflected functional limitations and participation restrictions after injury that likely improved due to treatment and time. Leisure-time physical activity, global mental health, and predicted quality of life were relatively unaffected by the LAS and probably stemmed from the patient’s resiliency and self-efficacy. When caring for patients who sustain musculoskeletal injuries, clinicians should consider using PROs that assess elements of both physical and mental health. Because of the inherent limited generalizability of a single case study, future investigation is needed to prospectively evaluate patients’ perceptions of function from preinjury to postinjury. We also acknowledge that the interventions used in this patient need to be empirically assessed. The report of a randomized controlled trial comparing a combined midfoot joint mobilization and HEP versus a sham mobilization and HEP is forthcoming.

For numbered affiliations see ABSTRACT and/or giving way in combination with recurrent end of article. This guideline aimed to advance current understandings regarding the diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic interventions for ankle sprains by updating the existing guideline and incorporate new research. A secondary objective was to provide an update related to the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic procedures, therapeutic interventions and prevention strategies. It was posited that subsequent interaction of clinicians with this guideline could help reduce health impairments and patient burden associated with this prevalent musculoskeletal injury. The previous guideline provided evidence that the severity of ligament damage can be assessed most reliably by delayed physical examination (4–5 days post trauma). After correct diagnosis, it can be stated that even though a short time of immobilisation may be helpful in relieving pain and swelling, the patient with an acute lateral ankle ligament rupture benefits most from use of tape or a brace in combination with an exercise programme.

New in this update: Participation in certain sports is associated with a heightened risk of sustaining a lateral ankle sprain. Care should be taken with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) usage after an ankle sprain. They may be used to reduce pain and swelling, but usage is not without complications and NSAIDs may suppress the natural healing process. Concerning treatment, supervised exercise-based programmes preferred over passive modalities as it stimulates the recovery of functional joint stability. Surgery should be reserved for cases that do not respond to thorough and comprehensive exercise-based treatment. For the prevention of recurrent lateral ankle sprains, ankle braces should be considered as an efficacious option.

INTRODUCTION

A lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is a frequently incurred musculoskeletal injury, with a high prevalence among the general population and individuals who participate in sports. About 40% of all traumatic ankle injuries occur during sports. For indoor sports, an incidence of 7 LAS per 1000 exposures has been reported. Despite the high prevalence and incidence of LAS injuries, it has been reported that only approximately 50% of individuals who incur a LAS seek medical attention. A large proportion of individuals who sustain a LAS will develop chronic ankle instability (CAI). CAI may be defined as persistent complaints of pain, swelling associated with recurrent sprains for at least 12 months after the initial ankle sprain, which in turn may lead to (long-term) absenteeism from work and sports. Treatment costs in combination with sick leave lead to a high socioeconomic burden. Additionally, associations with joint degeneration and osteochondral lesions have been reported over time. Adequate diagnosis, treatment and prevention of injury recurrence could forestall the development of long-term injury-associated symptoms and hence substantially reduce the associated socioeconomic burden.

In order to provide an update of the multidisciplinary clinical guideline, a multidisciplinary guideline committee was formed. The committee included health professionals who were directly involved in the care of patients with LAS in clinical practice or research environments and included general practitioners, emergency physicians, musculoskeletal radiologists, occupational physicians, orthopaedic surgeons, rehabilitation physicians, physical therapists, athletic trainers, sports massage therapists, sports physicians and trauma surgeons. This clinical guideline incorporates the most recently published peer-reviewed literature on the topic of LAS injury. The aim of this updated evidence-based clinical guideline is to facilitate uniformity of diagnosis and treatment of acute LAS injury, with the primary purpose of reducing the long-term injury-associated symptoms resulting from this prevalent injury.

The multidisciplinary guideline committee developed this update in order to assist all healthcare professionals, in both primary and secondary care settings, involved in the care of patients who have sustained an acute LAS injury. These include general practitioners, emergency physicians, musculoskeletal radiologists, occupational physicians, orthopaedic surgeons, rehabilitation physicians, physical therapists, athletic trainers, sports massage therapists, sports physicians, trauma surgeons and other professionals involved in lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries. This updated Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) will enable these healthcare professionals to provide optimal care for patients with LAS.

professionals to benefit from and implement the most up-to-date Br J Sports Med: first published as 10.1136/bjsports-2017-098106 on 7 March 2018. Downloaded from evidence-based recommendations concerning LAS.

**Table 1 Classification of methodological quality of individual studies**
|Classification of studies|Intervention|
|---|---|
|A1|Systematic review of at least two independently conducted studies of A2 level|
|A2|Randomised double-blind comparative clinical research of good quality and sufficient sample size|

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

The initial guideline was constrained in its recommendations due to limitations in available published literature, limiting assessment by means of meta-analyses. Due to the considerable number of new studies on LAS, it was decided by the guideline committee that an update of the original document was warranted.

Search and data collection

To provide updated recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of acute LAS injuries and the prevention of injury recurrence, a search was performed to identify all potential relevant articles published from January 2009—the search date of the initial guideline—up to September 2016 (online supplementary appendix 1).

The search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane and PEDro using the database-specific search translation on the topics of predisposing and prognostic factors, diagnostics, treatment, prevention and return to work and sports. For each subtopic addressed in this guideline, an individual search was performed, which is available in the appendix. All searches consisted of the common terms ‘ankle sprain’, ‘ankle injury’ and their database-specific synonyms, combined with topic-specific terms such as ‘prevention’ and all available synonyms. To ensure all relevant articles were identified, the current search results were combined with the articles identified by the initial guideline and references of all relevant articles were checked for possibly missed inclusions.

|Evidence level|Conclusions based on|
|---|---|
|1|Research of level A1 or at least two examinations of level A2 performed independently of each other with consistent results|
|2|One examination of level A2 or at least two examinations of level B, performed independently of each other|
|3|One examination of level B or C|
|4|Opinion of experts|

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they included individuals aged at least 16 years with acute LAS. Studies published in Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish, Danish or Swedish were all eligible for inclusion. Narrative reviews, case reports and cadaveric analyses were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria were reported medial ankle involvement, fractures or other concomitant injuries/pathology and CAI. In addition to the original search, a manual search of all reference lists of included studies was performed to identify relevant articles that may not have been identified by the search strategy. There were no inclusion or exclusion criteria formed regarding outcome measures. In addition to including all outcomes assessed in the previous guideline (see the individual searches in online supplementary appendix 1), all other outcomes concerning risk/prognostic factors, diagnostics, treatment, prevention and work/sports resumption were included. If multiple follow-up time points were included in the assessment, the latest postintervention assessment was included.

Evidence and guideline quality

Quality of evidence of included articles was classified in order of scientific value. Recommendations were based on the best available evidence. Statements formed by evidence from multiple studies, and the summarized level of evidence of the full statement was provided. The same was done for the level of evidence of the recommendations.

As this guideline concerns an update, as recommended by the EQUATOR-network, the CheckUp list was used for this guideline to help emphasize new information and changes implemented in this updated CPG. Additionally, the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation (AGREE) II criteria were followed in order to ensure complete reporting of methods and results and improve transparency and quality.

Data extraction

All outcomes that were described by at least two of the included studies were extracted for the meta-analyses (online supplementary appendix 1).

# Formulation of recommendations

Individual topics were assigned to the appropriate coauthors depending on their field of expertise in order to formulate recommendations based on the collected evidence. They subsequently received the corresponding studies to enable them to write the corresponding paragraph according to the method section predefined content to ensure uniformity. Results of these diagnostic, treatment and preventive recommendations were provided with the corresponding levels of evidence of the included conclusions. Aspects such as potential harm of interventions, patients’ perspective, costs and logistics were carefully considered when formulating the final recommendations. Recommendations were explicitly mentioned under ‘Recommendations’; including the full recommendation based on all the available evidence and including a statement about whether this recommendation changed since this update.

In addition to recommendations on diagnostics, an overview of treatment and prevention strategies is provided in tables 3 and 4

To ensure implementation of a multidisciplinary view in this CPG in all phases of rehabilitation after sustaining a LAS, the guideline committee consisted of an emergency medicine physician, epidemiologists, general practitioner, musculoskeletal radiologist, orthopaedic surgeons, movement scientists, physiotherapists and rehabilitation specialist (see affiliations). All members, apart from the two senior supervisors (RAdB and GMMJK), participated either in the search and selection of evidence or in reading, extracting and implementing data into this CGP. Apart from full review by all coauthors, the two senior authors additionally functioned as external reviewers by means of full detailed review to ensure this CPG was compliant with the AGREE II criteria and to optimise quality, assess applicability in clinical practise and feasibility of results.

Functional support: support such as tape or brace, preserving joint motion, but limiting extreme joint positions such as maximum inversion;

Functional outcome: outcome of treatment that leads to improvement of function such as pain reduction or range of motion (ROM) increase enabling patients to return to their preinjury level of activity and participation.

# RESULTS

To systematically evaluate and summarise all available evidence concerning LAS, a broad literature search was undertaken specifically related to the following areas: (1) predisposing and prognostic factors; (2) diagnostics, (3) treatment, (4) prevention and (5) return to work/sport. This search resulted in the identification of a total of 10 067 studies. After title and abstract screening and reading full texts, a total of 194 articles were eligible for inclusion in this guideline (online supplementary appendix 2). All fields of evidence with regard to relevant diagnostic tools, reliability of diagnostics, different treatment modalities and their efficacy, as well as prevention interventions including their cost-effectiveness will in turn be discussed. Recommendations will be provided based on the available level of evidence (tables 1 and 2).

# Predisposing factors

Predisposing factors are defined as factors that increase the risk of sustaining a LAS. Risk factors for LAS can be classified as either intrinsic (patient-related factors, eg, proprioception) or extrinsic (eg, sports or environmental characteristics). An important aspect that should be considered by clinicians when addressing predisposing factors is whether they can be modified or not. Modifiable risk factors may be targeted by (preventive) treatment.

# Intrinsic risk factors

There are a number of intrinsic risk factors, which substantially heighten the risk of sustaining a LAS. These include limited dorsiflexion ROM, reduced proprioception and (preseason)

# Consensus statement

The incidence of LAS was dependent on the level of participation. In volleyball, landing after a jump is the most important risk factor. Playing soccer on natural grass (vs artificial turf: RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.59) as well as being a defender (42.3% of all sprains) increased the incidence of LAS. Concerning shoe wear, high heels heighten the risk of incurring a LAS.

The only non-modifiable factor was sex. Despite girls having an increased risk of LAS compared with boys, in-competition risk for LAS is higher in boys compared with girls.

What’s new: The new search resulted in a significant increase in data. The subsequent performed meta-analyses made it possible to identify the size of the increased risk of playing soccer on natural grass, the risk associated with being a defender and the risk while playing sports at a competitive level. New recommendations are provided concerning the high impact of sport.

Recommendation (new): Extrinsic risk factors, although outside of the patient, may provide a significant increase in the risk at sustaining a LAS. Healthcare professionals involved in treating patients who sustain a LAS should take notice especially of the type of sport practised but also of other extrinsic risk factors, as modifications may lower the risk at future sprains and other ankle injuries.

# Prognostic factors

Following an acute LAS, pain decreases rapidly within the first two weeks after injury. However, a substantial proportion of patients report long-term unresolved injury-associated symptoms. At a follow-up of 1–4 years, patients still experience pain, patients experience recurrent sprains, and patients report instability. Additionally, a higher physical workload load may be associated with an increased risk of recurrent sprains and ankle instability. Even clinical signs of anterior impingement were found in patients.

Despite initial treatment consisting of taping/bracing and physical rehabilitation, up to 40% of individuals who have sustained a LAS develop CAI. Some of the known unfavourable prognostic factors identified for the development of CAI were an inability to complete jumping and landing within 2 weeks after a first-time LAS, deficiencies in dynamic postural control, altered hip joint kinematics, and lack of mechanical stability/increased ligament laxity 8 weeks after an ankle sprain. Other factors that may influence the prognosis are sports participation at a high level, being a young male, increased BMI, and greater body height.

Due to the neuromuscular origin of some of these prognostic factors, physical therapy might be helpful to improve physical impairments after a LAS and prevent progression to CAI. Based on the limited evidence concerning the risk factors for developing CAI following an ankle sprain, further research on prognostic factors is required and may provide additional and more uniform insights.

What’s new: Over the past years more data have become available on negative prognostic factors that may indicate slow or incomplete rehabilitation. This enabled us to modify the previous recommendation, which lacked a conclusion due to insufficient evidence.

# Diagnostics

In case of a severe ankle sprain, a fracture should be excluded by proper use of the Ottawa ankle rules (OAR), and if indicated, conventional radiographic imaging should be undertaken. Since only 15% of patients with LAS, who are examined using a radiograph, are diagnosed with an ankle fracture, the OAR have been developed to rule out a fracture. The OAR are an accurate and valid tool, which can be used with patients who have a suspected ankle/foot fracture within 1 week after the initial trauma. A high incidence of less serious traumas may lower the predictive value of the OAR in clinical practice.

To avoid unnecessary use of radiographs, the OAR are recommended as a primary physical examination tool to rule out the likelihood of foot/ankle fractures by emergency physicians, general practitioners or physiotherapists. The Bernese ankle rules (BAR) have been developed as a response to the high rate of unnecessary radiographs based on previous recommendation, which lacked a conclusion due to insufficient evidence.
---
# Consensus statement

OAR findings. However, the sensitivity of the BAR is too low to promote clinical use74 (level 2).

In general, ankle ligament injuries are classified into three grades representing increasing injury severity: grade I, mild ankle sprain; grade II, moderate sprain/microligament lesions; and grade III, severe sprain/full ligament lesion.75 In cases where a haematoma is present, accompanied by pain on palpation around the distal fibula and/or a positive anterior drawer test, a rupture of the lateral ankle ligaments likely exists. The sensitivity (84%) and specificity (96%) of physical examination using the anterior drawer test are optimised if clinical assessment is delayed for between 4 and 5 days post injury68 69 76 77 (level 2).

Ultrasonography has similar sensitivity (92%) but lacks specificity (64%) compared with delayed examination, and additionally depends on the availability of an experienced technician and equipment.69 78 In case of suspicion of high-grade ligament injuries, osteochondral defects, syndesmotic injuries and occult fractures, an MRI can be performed78

Evidence regarding the efficacy of compression therapy after acute LAS is also inconclusive (three RCTs, N=86)87–89 (level 2).

As a combined therapeutic modality, the use of RICE plus multimodal physiotherapy compared with RICE alone provides no additional benefits. Both treatments provide pain reduction, increase patient function and reduce ankle swelling (one RCT, n=28)92 (level 2).

Regarding the individual effects of rest and elevation after LAS, no evidence was available.

What’s new: No new statements could be made based on the newly identified studies. The increased evidence indicates that the individual aspects of RICE are not effective, apart from cryotherapy, if provided in combination with exercise therapy.

Recommendation (modified): There is no evidence that RICE alone, or cryotherapy, or compression therapy alone has any positive influence on pain, swelling or patient function. Therefore, there is no role for RICE alone in the treatment of acute LAS (level 2).

# Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

NSAIDs are commonly prescribed for patients who have sustained an acute LAS, with the primary purpose of reducing pain. Pooling the results of current studies shows that the use of oral or topical NSAIDs results in less pain in the short term (<14 days) without significantly increasing the risk of adverse events compared with placebo (26 RCTs, n=4225)93–97 (level 1) (table 3).

However, studies that included other NSAIDs instead of a placebo were excluded from this review98–102; additionally, the included participants were relatively young and healthy and thus potentially less prone to side effects. A comparison between selective NSAIDs (celecoxib 200 mg two times daily) and non-selective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac) (four RCTs, n=1490) concluded that celecoxib was non-inferior to non-selective NSAIDs for the primary outcome of pain following an acute LAS injury. Adverse events did not occur more frequently99 103–105 (level 1).

Diclofenac showed superior results at days 1 and 2 compared with piroxicam (two RCTs, n=201) and ibuprofen (one RCT, n=60) for reducing pain during motion in patients with mild-to-severe acute ankle sprains and equal adverse event rates98 101 (levels 2 and 3). Contradicting results have been reported on the effect of diclofenac for pain during rest, swelling and inflammation,.98 101 No differences in effect were seen when comparing a fixed dosage (500 mg two times daily) to an as-needed naproxen dosage (one RCT, n=135, MDpain−0.13 (−0.38 to 0.12))106 (level 3).

Despite dose differences, paracetamol (cq. acetaminophen) seems to be equally effective as NSAID usage (three RCTs, n=450) for pain (one RCT, n=86, MD 1.80, 95% CI −1.42 to 5.02), swelling (two RCTs, n=186, MD −0.07, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.14) and ROM (one RCT, n=100, MD 0.70, 95% CI −0.62 to 2.02)107–109 (level 1).

Opioid analgesics are equally effective for pain relief, but lead to significantly more side effects (two RCTs, n=869)100 110 (level 2). The use of NSAIDs may delay the natural healing process as the inflammation suppressed by NSAIDs is a necessary component of tissue recovery.111

# Treatment

Rest Ice Compression Elevation (RICE)

RICE is a conservative treatment method that has not been rigorously investigated, and the efficacy of this combination is questionable. The individual elements of ice and compression have been the subject of numerous scientific investigations; however, there is little scientific support for their efficacy in reducing injury-associated symptoms following acute LAS.

The limited available evidence showed that the efficacy of cryotherapy for reducing acute LAS injury-associated symptoms is unclear (33 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), n=2337)84 85 (level 1). There are no indications that the isolated use of ice can increase function, as well as decrease swelling and pain at rest among individuals who have sustained an acute LAS (27 RCTs, n=1670)84 86–90 (level 2). In combination with exercise therapy,

---
# Consensus statement

Besides these commonly prescribed analgesics, other pharmaceutical treatment modalities were described: venotonic drugs did not result in enhanced outcomes for pain and swelling compared with paracetamol and RICE (level 2); platelet-rich plasma injections were not superior for pain and functional outcomes compared with placebo injections (one RCT, n=37) (level 3), and topically applied Traumeel (one RCT, n=449) was not superior compared with diclofenac topical gel for ankle oedema, pain, and function. Periarticular hyaluronic acid injections compared with placebo (two RCTs; n=158) did not show a positive effect on pain, nor did they result in a quicker time to return to sport or reduced prevalence of recurrent sprains (level 2).

What’s new: New evidence emphasizes that the use of external supports (i.e., braces) is preferred over immobilization. Additionally, the preferred time frame during which the use of external support is advised is outlined. Overall, the core message of this section remains unchanged.

Recommendation (modified): Use of functional support for 4–6 weeks is preferred over immobilization. The use of an ankle brace shows the greatest effects compared with other types of functional support (level 2).

# Exercise

Among patients who seek professional healthcare following an acute LAS, exercise therapy is often an integral component of the treatment administered. Exercise therapy programs mainly consist of neuromuscular and proprioceptive exercises. Exercise therapy programs that are initiated early following an acute LAS injury have established efficacy. They can reduce the prevalence of recurrent injuries (10 RCTs, n=1284) (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.76), as well as the prevalence of functional ankle instability (3 RCTs, n=174) (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00). Furthermore, they are associated with a quicker time to recovery and enhanced outcomes (level 1). Including supervised physiotherapy has shown to have some benefit in patients with a severe ankle sprain compared with a mild LAS as measured by PROMs, with a home exercise program and when compared with supervised exercise therapy may lead to improvements in ankle strength and proprioception, faster return to work and sport, compared with performing the exercise program without supervision or guidance. Many articles, however, contradict these findings, concluding that there is no effect from the addition of supervised exercise therapy to conventional treatment alone (two RCTs, n=130) (level 2) nor an improvement of postural balance after exercise therapy.

# Immobilisation

A minimum of 4 weeks in a lower leg cast following an acute LAS results in less optimal outcomes compared with functional support and exercise strategies with a duration of 4–6 weeks (22 RCTs, n=2304) (level 1). More recent evidence (three RCTs, n=694) showed that a short period (<10 days) of immobilization with a plaster cast or rigid support can be of added value in the treatment of acute lateral ligament injury as it decreases pain and oedema and improves functional outcome (level 2).

What’s new: Despite the inclusion of new recent studies, there were no new findings.

Recommendation (not changed): Use of functional support and exercise therapy is preferred as it provides better outcomes compared with immobilization. If immobilization is applied to treat pain or oedema, it should be for a maximum of 10 days after which functional treatment should be commenced (level 2).

# Functional treatment

Functional supports in the form of an ankle brace or tape are often used following acute LAS. These external supports differ from rigid immobilization and allow the patient to load the damaged tissues in a protected manner. Treatment with any type of real ankle support was more effective compared with treatment with less adequate support such as a compression bandage or a tubigrip (level 2). Wearing compression stockings beyond the acute phase is not helpful in the treatment of acute lateral ankle ligament injury (level 3). The success of functional treatment is, however, dependent on the severity of the injury. For example, if a sprain is complicated by a ligament avulsion fracture results may be inferior to those in patients with isolated ligament injury.

The superiority of one external support over another is debated rigorously in the literature. A meta-analysis (n=892) showed a lace-up brace or a semi-rigid brace should be preferred to the use of an elastic bandage (level 1). Use of an ankle brace results in better outcome compared with other external support.

What’s new: New evidence has become available on the specific effects of different types of exercise/rehabilitation programs; especially the beneficial effect of exercise therapy on preventing recurrent sprains, reducing the risk of functional instability, and expediting the recovery of ankle joint function.

Recommendation (modified): Exercise therapy should be commenced after LAS to optimize recovery of joint functionality. Whether exercise therapy should be supervised or not remains unclear due to contradictory evidence and requires further research (level 1).

# Manual mobilisation

Manual joint mobilization can provide a short-term increase in ankle joint dorsiflexion ROM following acute LAS (12 RCTs, n=427) (level 1). Additionally, joint mobilization has been reported to decrease pain (level 1). Manual therapy combined with exercise therapy resulted in better outcomes compared with exercise therapy alone (level 3).

What’s new: Despite findings by the previous version of this guideline that manual mobilization only results in short-term treatment effects, current evidence shows added value of manual mobilization when used in combination with exercise therapy.
---
# Consensus statement

Recommendation (modified): A combination with other treatment modalities, such as exercise therapy, enhances the efficacy of manual joint mobilisation and is therefore advised (level 3).

Surgical therapy

Surgical therapy for acute lateral ligament injuries has been performed abundantly until it was recognised that conservative treatment provides equal effects and that not all patients require surgery in order to resolve complaints148–151 (level 1). Nowadays, surgery is mainly reserved for patients who have chronic instability after a LAS and who have not responded to a comprehensive exercise-based physiotherapy programme. Long-term effects of surgical treatment in cases of acute lateral ligament injury correspond with those of functional treatment. Surgery seems superior at decreasing the prevalence of recurrent LAS, which is important as recurrent LAS in turn may increase the risk for the subsequent development of osteoarthritis (one RCT, n=51)13 (level 2). There is limited evidence for longer recovery times, higher incidences of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in patients who received surgical treatment (20 RCTs, n=2562)150 (level 1). More recent studies show that outcomes in terms of recovery of ankle activity and instability are significantly better for surgical treatment than for functional treatment (12 RCTs, n=1413)152 (level 1). As a previous sprain is a predictor for recurrent ankle sprains, this may be related to increased ligament laxity. This laxity is resolved during surgery. Based on this indirect evidence, it may be suggested that surgical therapy helps prevent recurrent ankle sprains. However, a large percentage (60%–70%) of individuals who sustain a LAS respond well to non-surgical treatment programmes,149

What’s new: New evidence supports the rationale for being reserved with the recommendation of surgery for all patients following LAS. This lead to refinement of the recommendation regarding surgery.

Recommendation (modified): Despite good clinical outcomes of surgery after both chronic injuries and an acute complete lateral ligament rupture, functional treatment is still the preferred method as not all patients require surgical treatment. This also helps to avoid unnecessary exposure to invasive (over) treatment and unnecessary risk of complications149 152 (level 1). However, treatment decisions have to be made on an individual basis. In professional athletes, surgical treatment may be preferred to ensure quicker return to play.151

Other therapies

Other treatment modalities less frequently used do not always show a treatment effect. For example, no effect on pain, oedema, function and return to play has been shown for ultrasound153 154 (level 1), laser therapy155 159–163 (level 1), electrotherapy156–158 (level 2) in the treatment of acute LAS. Evidence on acupuncture is inconclusive concerning the studies164 165 (level 1). A small cohort study indicated that local therapeutic effect due to large heterogeneity between choice of usage should depend on personal preferences.

What’s new: Acupuncture, vibration therapy and Bioptron light therapy were added to the present update. Concerning the beneficial effect of Bioptron light therapy in addition to cryotherapy167 (level 3).

Communication between professionals

Since there are various disciplines involved in the care for patients with LAS, it is preferable to make working arrangements at a regional level on indications for referral, division of tasks and what information is provided by healthcare professionals. The different disciplines involved in primary and secondary care are emergency physicians, sports masseurs and physical therapists, sports physicians and general practitioners, orthopaedic and trauma surgeons, radiologists, medical officers for occupational medicine and rehabilitation physicians. Within referral between healthcare professionals, optimal communication is preferred. What information should be communicated between healthcare professionals depends on the phase of LAS; the diagnostic phase, the treatment phase and the guidance phase.14 168–170

What’s new: The checklist and statements from the previous version of this guideline were not subject to change. The most important factor remains communication.

Recommendation (not changed): To refine communication between healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of patients with LAS, a communication check list is recommended (table 4).14 168–170

Prevention

Functional support

The use of brace or tape reduces the risk of both recurrent (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.43) and first-time ankle sprains (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.96), especially in those who participate in sports4 125 171 172 (level 1). Kinesiotape may also have a preventive effect in patients who have already sustained a LAS due to its effects on postural control171 (five RCTs, n=276) (level 1). The use of a brace or tape is a personal choice and based on practical usability and costs. Associated adverse events are rare.4 125 171 172 Ankle brace or tape usage has not shown any beneficial effects on proprioceptive acuity in patients who sustained recurrent ankle sprains or those who have functional ankle instability (eight RCTs, n=152) (level 1). This conclusion was consistent when the two aspects of proprioception, sense of movement and joint position, were considered separately.129 No differences in prevention of recurrent sprains were found between different types of tape and brace as support.117 172 173

What’s new: In addition to updating the risk ratios by including new studies, a risk ratio is provided for the preventive effect of tape and brace for first-time ankle sprains. Additionally information on the effect on proprioception and adverse events was included. This new evidence did not change the previous recommendation.

Recommendation (not changed): Both tape and brace have a role in the prevention of recurrent LAS despite limited evidence on mechanisms that leads to these beneficial effects (level 1). The choice of usage should depend on personal preferences.

Exercise therapy

Coordination and balance training have been shown to prevent recurrent ankle sprains.4 The assessment of the effect of exercise therapy as in neuromuscular training (mainly proprioception) has shown a positive effect towards prevention of LAS132 139 173–175 and especially recurrent LAS. A meta-analysis (two RCTs, n=130)

Illustrated that exercise therapy had a protective effect compared identification of the prognosis in relation to return to work184 with usual care on preventing recurrent LAS (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.76). Usual care was defined as ‘any form of rehabilitative treatment used by the athlete, without any interference from et al).176 This effect is even larger in athletes (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.62)38 177 (level 1).

When exposing athletes with recurrent sprains to proprioceptive training, to improve joint position sense, their risk of recurrence of LAS is reduced to the same level as healthy controls4 42 177–180 (level 3). Exercise therapy such as coordination and balance training mainly seem to be effective for recurrent ankle sprains up to 12 months after the initial sprain,4 131 176 181 but not on first-time ankle sprains21 38 175 182 (level 1).

# What’s new:

More positive effects of different training programmes have become available, strengthening the recommendation of the previous guideline.

# Recommendation (not changed):

For this reason, it is advised to start exercise therapy, especially in athletes, as soon as possible after the initial sprain to prevent recurrent LAS. Exercise therapy should be included into regular training activities as much as possible as home-based exercise (level 1). The preventive effect of exercise therapy for first-time LAS lacks evidence (table 6).

Footwear: No evident conclusions exist on the role of footwear in the prevention of ankle sprains (level 2). Wearing low-fitted or high-fitted shoes did not show any difference in preventive effect (three RCTs, n=3410)4 172 183 (level 1). Despite the lack of evidence, some authors prefer high-fitted shoes,73 117 120 (level 1). Possibly shoes being new is of greater importance compared with the height of the shaft of the shoe in preventing ankle sprains.4

# What’s new:

New evidence corresponded with the evidence found in the previous guideline.

# Recommendation (not changed):

Due to the inconclusiveness of evidence, no recommendations can be made concerning shoe wear (level 1).

# Resuming work

---
# Consensus statement

Recommendation (modified): To speed up return to work, a brace and immediate functional treatment in combination with a return to work schedule are advised (level 3). Ankle support may be indicated to facilitate return to work. A semirigid brace is suggested to be the most cost-effective option compared with taping (level 3).

# Sport resumption

LAS may lead to multiple problems such as proprioception disturbances. These disturbances seem to originate from the central nervous system above the level of the spinal reflex (level 2) and may result in functional instability. Additionally, delayed response time of the peroneal muscle has been detected, possibly due to traction injury of the peroneal nerve. However, motor-unit insufficiencies seen after a LAS seem to last shorter than those after other lateral ankle injuries not based on an inversion trauma mechanism (level 2). Strength deficits are present following LAS. For these reasons, early functional treatment is advised and should address proprioception, muscle response time and muscle strength, enabling early return to sport participation (level 2).

# Prevention

Preventive efforts against first-time and recurrent ankle sprains have shown high cost benefits (level 3). Both neuromuscular training and ankle braces have been proven beneficial as a preventive investment due to lower societal costs, mainly achieved through reduced indirect costs (level 2). Comparisons between measures have indicated bracing to be superior to taping and neuromuscular training as a preventive option (level 1). Of note is that the latter statement is only valid for the preventive value of bracing. Neuromuscular training has been associated with clinical benefits other than prevention alone, which should also be considered (level 1).

# DISCUSSION

After an acute LAS it is important to first exclude the presence of any fractures. To this end the OAR can be used, having a high sensitivity and specificity. Subsequently, functional treatment in the form of exercise and functional support (ie, brace or tape) is preferred over immobilisation. Still a short time of immobilisation may help diminish complaints of pain and swelling in case of a lateral ligament injury. In case of ROM restriction, mobilisation therapy may provide help, but combination with exercise therapy is advised. Surgery should be reserved for patients with lateral ligament ruptures to avoid unnecessary invasive treatment and risk of complications. In the prevention of ankle sprains, functional support is effective in patients with both first-time and recurrent LAS, but seems most effective in preventing recurrent sprains. Exercise therapy, however, has only shown a significant preventive effect for recurrent ankle sprains. For first-time LAS, there was mainly a lack of evidence as studies did not explicitly name whether their included population had previously suffered a LAS or not. Additionally, this may be explained by a lack of research on exercise in a population who has never suffered a LAS as exercise is mostly commenced after injury during rehabilitation.

# Cost-effectiveness

Estimated societal costs of ankle sprains, as reported in the literature, vary between €360 and €1100 per individual (level 2). Although most patients with ankle sprain do not receive supervised rehabilitation (level 3), these values indicate that ankle sprains have a substantial financial impact on society. Additionally, added to these costs in the short term, patients with ankle sprain are at risk of developing chronic conditions, which in turn may lead to subsequent costs. Consequently, optimized treatment and prevention will provide economic benefits in addition to clinical effects for the individual.

# Diagnostics

The OAR provide a valid and reliable cost-effective tool to diagnose fractures after an ankle sprain (level 3). In 1995, it was shown that implementing the OAR as opposed to existing hospital protocols resulted in cost savings. More recently, implementation of the OAR through emergency department nurses has been shown to be a cost-effective method to diagnose and manage ankle sprains. As an alternative to the OAR, the low-risk ankle rule provides a cost-effective tool to diagnose pediatric ankle fractures, with an estimated reduction in required radiographs.

# Treatment

Functional treatment is clinically the treatment strategy of choice for ankle sprains. No full cost-effectiveness studies are known to compare functional treatment against immobilisation as treatment. In regards to indirect costs, a functional approach leads to the fastest resumption of work and daily life activities compared to immobilisation.

|Modality|Recommendation|Level of evidence|
|---|---|---|
|Predisposing factors|In the treatment of patients with LAS, modifiable risk factors should be identified and, if possible, addressed.|2–3|
|Prognostic factors|Assessed of prognostic factors during the rehabilitation process in order to address negative modifiable factors.|3|
|Diagnostics|Late physical examination is advised to come to conclusions on the severity of the ligament damage.|2|
|RICE|RICE is not advised as treatment modality after a LAS.|2|
|NSAIDs|NSAIDs may be used to reduce pain and swelling.|2|
|Immobilisation|Immobilisation should not be used in the treatment of a LAS.|2|
|Functional support|Functional support is preferred over immobilisation, especially the use of a brace. For prevention, both tape and brace may be used. Choice of modality should always be based on patient preferences.|2|
|Exercise|Exercise therapy should be started as soon as possible to recover joint functionality. For recurrent ankle sprains, exercise should be included in regular training activities as much as possible.|1|
|Manual mobilisation|Manual mobilisation is only advised in combination with other treatment modalities to enhance the treatment effect.|3|
|Surgery|Surgery is only advised for patients that require quick recovery, such as professional athletes, or whose complaints are not resolved by conservative treatment to avoid unnecessary invasive treatment on patients that would just as well recover from conservative treatment.|1|
|Other therapies|Based on current evidence, other modalities than the once mentioned above are not advised.|2|
|Interprofessional communication|A communication checklist should be used to ensure communication errors.|1|
|Footwear|No recommendations can be made concerning footwear due to inconclusiveness of evidence.|1|
|Work resumption|Immediate functional treatment and a return to work schedule are advised to minimize work absenteeism.|3|
|Sport resumption|Supervised exercises are advised with the focus on proprioception, strength, coordination and function.|1|

Future perspectives and research

This update provides the most recent evidence on diagnostics, treatment and prevention for acute LAS. As more evidence has become available, often of a higher evidence level, this enabled the use of meta-analyses where there was a lack of evidence in the initial guideline. However, not all recommendations were supported by meta-analysis. Also, some recommendations lack evidence from RCTs. A future update might be required if enough new studies become available. Thus this guideline may be updated after 5–10 years to ensure content and recommendations remain up to date using the same methodology and search strategy. If relevant new treatment methods, preventive techniques or other aspects are identified, these will receive appropriate attention depending on their importance for patients who sustained a LAS. In a future update, the methodological quality may be included to formulate conclusions based on the quality and reliability of results, as may be done using the GRADEpro tool.

Future research is required in the field of different functional treatment and prevention strategies, identifying superiority between different types of support and training and for which specific subpopulations these are effective (eg, recurrent or first-time LAS). Additional research may be performed on preferences of patients and healthcare professionals: what do patients prefer on forehand before undergoing treatment and what were their experiences? Which treatments do healthcare professionals prefer and is this dependent on injury severity, and so on, as this may contribute to formulating future recommendations.

# Summary

Injury typified by sudden, painful, audible pop noise. Patient typically presents with inability to return to activity, joint instability, and rapid development of effusion (haemarthrosis).

- Often tender at lateral femoral condyle, lateral tibial plateau, and tibiofemoral joint lines.
- A positive Lachman's test is most accurate right after the injury and the pivot shift test is more useful in sub-acute or chronic cases.
- History and physical examination usually provide accurate diagnosis.
- X-rays obtained to rule out avulsion fractures or other related conditions, but do not directly identify ACL injury. MRI delineates ACL tears nicely, along with associated injury to menisci and other structures.
- Initial treatment for most patients consists of protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and analgesia (as appropriate). Subsequent treatment varies by an individual patient's health and fitness status and goals. Treatment may range from minimal or no additional intervention to bracing, physiotherapy, and activity modification, and to surgical reconstruction (either early or delayed).

# BASICS

|Anterior cruciate ligament injury|Definition|
|---|---|
|A torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) usually occurs as the result of an acute non-contact deceleration injury, forceful hyperextension, or excessive rotational forces about the knee.[1] [2] The ligament may be completely torn, partially torn, or avulsed from its origin or insertion. The ACL is the primary restraint to excessive anterior translation and rotation of the tibia on the femur; therefore, complete ACL disruption typically results in dynamic knee instability or the inability to respond to quick changes in position.[3]| |
|Epidemiology| |
|The 15- to 45-year-old age group is at highest risk. Injuries occur primarily among active people, especially in sport involving cutting, pivoting, and decelerating (e.g., soccer, basketball, skiing) or contact (e.g., rugby). About 70% of ACL tears occur during sport activities. In children, falling off of a bike while trying to plant the ipsilateral foot is a common mechanism of ACL avulsion from the tibial eminence.[8]| |
|The estimated US incidence is 100,000 to 200,000 ACL tears per year, with 100,000 ACL reconstructions per year.[9] The female-to-male ratio has generally ranged from 2:1 to 8:1, and varies across sports.[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Non- or minimal-contact injuries account for majority of ACL injuries (up to 70%), especially in females.[1] [15] [16] One recent study suggests a higher rate for white European American basketball players than for non-white players.[17]| |
|Aetiology| |
|ACL injury occurs when the forces placed upon the ligament exceed its ability to handle those forces. Alternatively, the bony insertion of the ACL may be weaker than the ligament and may avulse from the underlying bone. The ligament may remain intact or may partially tear. Avulsion is most common in children.[7] [18]| |
|Pathophysiology| |
|The ACL originates from the posteromedial aspect of the intercondylar notch on the lateral femoral condyle. It inserts broadly onto the articular surface of the tibia, medial to the attachment of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. The ACL prevents excessive anterior translation of the tibia on the femur and also acts to minimise tibial rotation and resist valgus and varus forces.[3] [19] The ACL receives a rich blood supply, primarily from the middle geniculate artery, so when the ACL is ruptured, a haemarthrosis usually develops rapidly. However, despite its intra-articular location, the ACL is actually extrasynovial. Due to the poor intrinsic healing properties of the ACL, a torn ACL will not heal on its own. Over time, the damaged fibres may scar down to the posterior cruciate ligament or to the intercondylar notch. This may result in confusing findings on physical examination but rarely if ever results in functional stability.[20]| |

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury Prevention

# Primary prevention

Efforts have focused on training programmes targeting proprioception, neuromuscular control, and proper sport-specific technique. Initial results of these programmes have generally been encouraging, and results of a systematic review have suggested that ACL injury prevention training programmes have a substantial beneficial effect in reducing risk of ACL injury - particularly in male athletes. However, further work is required to determine the ideal regimen for specific sports.

# Screening

Sport medicine specialists screen for ACL injuries in athletes during pre-participation physical examinations by means of focused questioning and knee examination. Occasionally, a previously unidentified ACL injury is detected. More commonly, predisposing factors for ACL injury (e.g., previous ACL injury, poor proprioception, impaired core control, ligamentous laxity) may be detected, allowing preventive measures to be taken.

# Secondary prevention

Prevention of ACL injuries has generally focused on high-risk athletes, such as females involved in soccer, skiing, and basketball. Multiple small studies have shown that training programmes that develop proper footwork, landing technique, correct body alignment, improved proprioception, strength, fitness, and neuromuscular recruitment patterns can decrease the risk of significant knee injury. Furthermore, results of a systematic review suggest that ACL injury prevention training programs have a substantial beneficial effect in reducing risk of ACL injury in athletes - particularly male athletes. These measures can be instituted as secondary prevention to minimise the risk of ipsilateral recurrence or contralateral injury, but may also be effective as primary prevention. A brace is usually worn initially when an athlete is returning to play after ACL reconstruction, but there is no definitive proof that any brace actually decreases the risk of an ACL injury. Other approaches include rule changes (e.g., eliminating certain blocks and tackles in football), further study of the risks and benefits of various footwear types, ski boots and bindings, and playing surfaces, and further investigation of biochemical, biomechanical, and genetic factors that may increase risk of ACL injury.

# DIAGNOSIS

Anterior cruciate ligament injury
Diagnosis

# Case history #1

A 20-year-old female basketball player lands awkwardly from a rebound, feels a sudden painful pop in her right knee, and falls to the ground. She is unable to return to play and feels that her knee keeps giving out when she tries to bear weight. She reports that her knee became very swollen within 1 or 2 hours after the injury.

# Case history #2

A 30-year-old football player was injured when his left knee was rolled into accidentally by a teammate. The patient felt the knee hyperextend, bend inward, and pop. He was unable to keep playing and complained that his knee felt like it kept twisting. The knee swelled moderately over the next few hours.

Other presentations:

ACL tears may also occur after slips and falls, twisting injuries to the knee, and high-energy injuries (e.g., motor vehicle accidents). The ACL may be injured alone (isolated) or as part of a more complex injury (multiple ligamentous injuries, meniscal tear, knee dislocation).

Complete, intrasubstance tears of the ligament are the most commonly seen injury. Many partial tears involve enough fibres to cause significant instability. ACL bony avulsion (tibial eminence) injuries mainly occur in skeletally immature individuals.

In children, falling off of a bike while trying to plant the ipsilateral foot is a common mechanism of ACL avulsion from the tibial eminence.

# Step-by-step diagnostic approach

The key to diagnosis of an ACL injury is a thorough history and physical examination. Many patients are seen in the emergency department, informed of normal x-ray results, and are given the non-specific diagnosis of a knee sprain. Unless proper follow-up evaluation occurs, accurate diagnosis and treatment may not occur.

History:

Key historical features indicating an ACL injury include a high-risk mechanism (contact or non-contact, as described above), an audible pop at the time of injury, rapid development of haemarthrosis, inability to return to play, pain, and a feeling that the knee is unstable or buckles with attempted weight bearing. History of prior ACL injury and female sex should also heighten suspicion. Patients are often adolescents and young adults, or middle-aged individuals who are involved in extensive exercise.

Physical examination:

Physical examination usually reveals a haemarthrosis if the injury was recent. Chronic ACL tears may or may not have an associated effusion. Acutely, range of motion is usually impaired, especially in flexion. This may be due to a combination of pain and stiffness from haemarthrosis, as well as associated bone.

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury

Diagnosis

bruise, meniscal tears, or articular cartilage injury.[46] Tenderness is found at the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau.

Lachman's test is the most accurate manoeuvre for detecting an acute ACL tear, whereas the pivot shift test performs better in chronic tears or under anaesthesia.[47] [48] Lachman's test involves putting the patient supine and while placing one hand behind the tibia and the other on the patient's thigh, the knee is at about 20 to 30 degrees in flexion. With the clinician's thumb on the tibial tuberosity, the tibia is pulled anteriorly. If the ACL is intact, a firm endpoint is found. If this does not occur, and there is more than 2 mm of anterior movement compared with the uninjured knee, the test is positive, suggesting a torn ACL.

Anterior drawer testing will often be positive, but is less sensitive and specific.[49] This test involves placing the patient in a supine position and flexing the hips to 45 degrees, with the knees at 90 degrees and feet on the table. Sitting on the patient's feet, the clinician takes hold of the tibia and pulls it anteriorly. If the tibia moves more than usual, the test is positive.

The varus/valgus stress test is a standard part of the physical examination. Although not specific for identifying ACL tears, this testing is necessary to evaluate for other or concomitant injuries.

It is crucial to perform these tests gently and smoothly, and have the patient relax. Otherwise, the patient's discomfort and fear may lead to guarding, tensing of the hamstrings, and false-negative or inconclusive results. The pivot shift manoeuvre is another test performed usually under anaesthesia in the operating room before or after reconstruction surgery. Technically difficult, but is the best test for dynamic rotatory instability.[50]

Usually not indicated, but sometimes done for symptom relief if tense haemarthrosis present, or to assist with diagnosis in confusing cases.

# Imaging

X-rays are usually negative, but may reveal the lateral capsular sign/Segond's fracture, a small capsular avulsion off the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia.[51] This is uncommon but virtually pathognomonic for ACL tear. MRI has excellent sensitivity and specificity for ACL tears, and can reveal associated injuries. However, MRI is not necessary if the clinical diagnosis is clear.[52]

MRI is often ordered as an initial test, especially in high-level athletes. However, this practice is generally unnecessary and is not supported by evidence-based research. MRI may be more useful diagnostically when the clinical examination is impaired by factors such as patient guarding, tense effusion, or a locked joint (intra-articular block from displaced meniscal tear, etc.). MRI can also be helpful when evaluating the possibility of a torn ACL graft.[53] From a surgical perspective, there is some evidence that preoperative MRI may be helpful in determining the suitability of a given patient's patellar tendon for use in an ACL bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft.[54]

# DIAGNOSIS

|Anterior cruciate ligament injury|Diagnosis|
|---|---|
|Risk factors| |
|Strong| |
|acute trauma| |
|Contact injuries, especially with hyperextension and/or valgus stress, are a classic cause of ACL tears.[21] Non-contact injuries, especially involving sudden deceleration, pivoting, change in direction, landing from a jump, or excessive rotation and extension, are responsible for the majority of ACL tears.[22] [23] [24]| |
|female sex (after puberty)| |
|Many studies have shown a significantly increased risk of ACL tears among female athletes compared with their male counterparts. Many theories have been advanced to explain this disparity.[25]| |
|poor technique for landings| |
|Poorly trained athletes without good skills are at a higher risk for improperly planting their feet and injuring the ACL.[26]| |
|history of previous ACL injury| |
|May be ipsilateral or contralateral.[27]| |
|use of cleats or spikes| |
|Cleats and spikes used during sport on grassy surfaces increase the likelihood of planting a foot and twisting the body without release, consequently twisting upon the knee joint.[29]| |
|rough or uneven playing surface| |
|Playing surfaces that are uneven or have increased friction increase the probability of turning the body while a foot remains planted.[30] [31]| |
|ground condition/weather| |
|Poor conditions with snow, sleet, or rain increase the likelihood of slips, falls, and improper landings, all increasing risk of ACL tears.[32] [33] [34]| |
|fatigue| |
|Athletes who are tired are more likely to move improperly and to make poor decisions, both of which increase risk of injury.[35] [36]| |
|adolescent, young adults, and middle-aged athletes| |
|Increased risk in adolescents and young adults, but middle-aged athletes/skiers also involved. Skeletally immature athletes more likely than adults to avulse ACL insertion rather than have intra-substance tear.| |
|Weak| |
|aggressive athlete with higher skill level| |
|Athletes who play more aggressively have a higher propensity for injury.[28]| |

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury Diagnosis

History & examination factors

Key diagnostic factors

- Risk factors include acute trauma, female sex (after puberty), poor technique for landings, history of previous ACL injury, aggressive aplete wip higher skill level, use of cleats or spikes, rough or uneven playing surface, ground condition/weaper, fatigue, adolescent, young adults, and middle-aged apletes.

audible pop (common)

- Reported in up to 70% of ACL tears. If positive, greatly heightens suspicion, but lack of pop does not rule out ACL injury.

rapid knee swelling (common)

- Usually present acutely, wipin few hours after injury. Patient usually reports rapid development of large amount of knee swelling.

inability to return to activity (common)

- Patient may be able to hobble or jog a little but is rarely able to return to full activity.

sensation of knee instability or buckling (common)

- Patient often describes sensation of femur and tibia twisting apart from each oper or pe knee feeling loose.

pain (common)

- Varies greatly. Some describe minimal pain, opers describe severe pain. Not a very useful discriminator.

positive Lachman's test (common)

- The most accurate manoeuvre for detecting an acute ACL tear, whereas pe pivot shift test performs better in chronic tears or under anaespesia. Lachman's test involves putting pe patient supine and while placing one hand behind pe tibia and pe oper on pe patient's pigh, pe knee is at about 20 to 30 degrees in flexion. Wip pe clinician's pumb on pe tibial tuberosity, pe tibia is pulled anteriorly. If pe ACL is intact, a firm end point is found. If a soft end-point is found, and pere is more pan 2 mm of anterior movement compared wip pe uninjured knee, pe test is positive, suggesting a torn ACL.

positive pivot shift manoeuvre (common)

- The patient is in pe lateral decubitus position and pe examiner holds pe patient's leg wip bop hands. The knee is at 20 degrees of flexion and pe patient is asked to relax pe muscles. The examiner pen places pe knee in full extension and internally rotates pe tibia. Then pe knee is pushed from pe lateral side and flexed. If a clunk is felt at 30 degrees, pe test is positive for ACL rupture.

# DIAGNOSISAnterior cruciate ligament injury

Diagnosis

- Highly specific, less sensitive, especially acutely. Technically difficult to perform for many physicians, but best test for dynamic rotatory instability. May correlate better wip real world function pan pe oper tests.[50] Usually done under anaespesia in operating room prior to/after reconstruction.
- Oper diagnostic factors tenderness at lateral femoral condyle, lateral tibial plateau (common)
- Often due to kissing bone bruises pat occur when femur and tibia bang against each oper when ACL tears. Tenderness at tibiofemoral joint line itself may also indicate a meniscal tear, but difficult to distinguish on initial examination.
- Positive anterior drawer test (common)
- This test involves placing pe patient in a supine position, flexing pe hips to 45 degrees, wip pe knees at 90 degrees and feet on pe table. Sitting on pe patient's feet, pe clinician takes hold of pe tibia and pulls it anteriorly. If pe tibia moves more pan usual, pe test is positive. Testing will often be positive, but is less sensitive and specific.[49]

Diagnostic tests

1. 1st test to order

|Test|Result|
|---|---|
|x-rays|impaction fracture - Ottawa knee rules recommend x-rays in acute knee injury in an adult if any of the following features is present:[56]
- Inability to bear weight at time of injury and at time of evaluation
- Isolated tenderness at patella or fibular head
- Active flexion of knee <90 degrees
- Age >55
- Ottawa guidelines have excellent sensitivity (up to 100%) for detecting fracture about the knee and significantly decrease unnecessary use of x-rays, but most acute knee injuries, including ACL tears, are not associated with fracture visible on x-ray.[57]
- The absence of bony injury on x-ray does not imply ACL injury has not occurred.
- Although x-rays are usually negative, they may reveal the lateral capsular sign/Segond fracture, a small capsular avulsion off the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia.

# DIAGNOSIS

|Condition|Differentiating signs / symptoms|Differentiating tests|
|---|---|---|
|Medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain|• The pop sound at injury is less common and true dynamic instability is rare, unless it is a complete tear or with associated injuries. May be able to continue activity if minor sprain. No significant haemarthrosis in isolated MCL sprain, although reactive effusion not uncommon. Tender over MCL course/insertion. MCL stress testing reveals laxity and/or pain. Additionally, Lachman's and pivot shift tests are negative. Spontaneous healing and full return of function is the rule.[58]|• MRI reveals fluid around or injury to MCL; ACL appears intact. Subsequent x-rays may reveal calcification along previously injured MCL (Pellegrini-Stieda disease).|
|Posterior collateral ligament (PCL) sprain|• Often able to continue activity but knee does not feel right subjectively to the patient. Instability may be more subtle, with knee effusion typically smaller and less noticeable by the patient. Lachman's, pivot shift, anterior drawer tests are negative, but the posterior drawer test is positive. External rotation recurvatum test will show posterolateral corner instability. Unlike with ACL tears, non-operative approach often allows return to full activity.[59]|• MRI reveals disrupted PCL, and an intact ACL.|
|Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) sprain|• Local swelling is common, but significant effusion is rare. There is tenderness over the lateral collateral ligament and/or bony insertion. A complete tear often results in a palpable gap. Spontaneous healing|• MRI reveals fluid around or disruption to LCL, with intact ACL.|

and full return of function is pe rule.[60]

# Meniscal tear

Meniscal injury may also occur wip ACL tear or oper significant injury. Main symptom is pain at affected joint line and stiffness. Effusion typically develops over 1 to 2 days, but rapid haemarprosis may occur if large tear in vascular portion of meniscus.[61] [62]
Physical examination manoeuvres have poor accuracy, but joint line tenderness is common, as is pain wip rotational manoeuvres (e.g., positive McMurray's test).

# Posterior capsular sprain

Small effusion and stiffness common, along wip painful extension. ACL and oper ligaments are stable.[64]
Imaging rarely necessary. MRI may show effusion, bone bruising, abnormal signal at posterior capsule, but no frank ligament disruption.

# Patellar subluxation or dislocation

Patient feels severe pain around patella; may see kneecap off to pe side. Haemarprosis occurs, wip difficulty in weight bearing, and a sensation of pe kneecap being unstable. Examination usually reveals haemarprosis, tenderness at patella and medial retinaculum, and apprehension when examiner attempts to displace patella laterally. ACL testing should be normal.[65]
X-rays may reveal dislocation if not yet reduced, or patellar fracture. Lateral subluxation and abnormal patellofemoral relationship often noted. MRI often reveals bone bruising, and may show chondral injury, osteochondral fracture, or loose body.[66]

# TREATMENT

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury

# Treatment approach

The main goals of treatment for an isolated ACL tear are the following:

- Alleviate symptoms
- Restore function
- Minimise complications

Initial treatment consists of protected weight bearing, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and bracing. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or analgesics may help control pain and swelling, but do not alter the course of the injury. Treatment should be tailored to individual preference, along with the exact nature of the injury. The PRICEM acronym defines the initial treatment of all patients.

- P = Protected weight-bearing exercise with crutches or crutch assisted with a knee immobiliser or similar brace. Avoid prolonged immobiliser use, as severe stiffness and discomfort can develop
- R = Relative rest
- I = Ice: useful for first several days as helps minimise pain and swelling
- C = Compression
- E = Elevation
- M = Medicines (analgesics, NSAIDs as needed)

Patients can be broadly divided into the following 3 groups:

- Sedentary
- Intense dynamic demands
- Moderate intensity demands

# Physiotherapy goals

Gentle (pain-free) active range-of-motion exercises can be instituted within the first few days after injury. Physiotherapy (home or formal) can then proceed, with treatment frequency based on the patient's specific situation. Initial therapy goals include relieving pain and swelling, and re-establishing full range of motion. Subsequent goals include regaining strength, proprioception, and dynamic stability. No methodologically sound evidence has shown superiority of any one particular rehabilitation programme. If the patient is not improving as expected or decides on operative management, in most cases nothing is lost with an initial trial of physiotherapy. However, if the patient experiences recurrent tibiofemoral subluxation episodes, this can lead to meniscal tears and articular cartilage damage.

# Sedentary individuals

The first group consists of sedentary people who have low physical demands, are poor surgical candidates, and/or are not interested in pursuing high-level treatment. Such patients may be best treated with home physiotherapy exercises, knee bracing, and activity modification to minimise risk of instability episodes.

# Intense dynamic demands

At the other end of the spectrum are patients with high activity levels and intense physical demands (such as professional athletes) requiring dynamic knee stability. Examples include high-level athletes in sports that require frequent cutting, pivoting, jumping, and deceleration (such as soccer, basketball, rugby).
---
# Anterior cruciate ligament injury

Treatment

Competitive skiing, gymnastics), and people who perform heavy manual labour or who work in a setting where knee instability could prove dangerous (e.g., roofers, construction workers, police, or military personnel). These patients are usually best served by surgical reconstruction of the ACL. However, there is evidence to suggest that non-surgical management may be an appropriate choice for some patients with moderate to high activity levels, and that rehabilitation should be considered as a primary treatment option in these patients.[69] [70] In addition, studies comparing rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction with rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction has found no difference in outcomes between these two approaches in young active adults with an acute ACL tear.[69] [70]

ACL reconstruction is performed primarily to restore the functional stability of the knee. The surgery can be performed soon after the injury, generally as soon as the swelling has resolved and good range of motion has been restored (usually within the first 1-2 weeks after injury in motivated patients who receive proper initial treatment as above). Surgeries are usually performed as out-patient procedures under general or spinal anaesthesia, with or without an intra-articular anaesthetic. The surgical time ranges from 1 to 3 hours. Risks of the surgery include infection, DVT/venous thrombo-embolism, neurovascular injury, loss of motion, patellofemoral pain, harvest site pain, patellar fracture, tendon rupture, and pain from hardware.

The initial post-operative course depends upon procedure, patient characteristics, and surgeon's preference. The patient can expect to be up on crutches and wearing a brace that day. Cold, elevation, and other modalities are commonly employed. Physiotherapy begins within the first few days post-operatively. Immobiliser use, bracing, and specific physiotherapy regimens vary.[71] [72] [73] Ongoing care using braces, rest, non-weight-bearing exercise, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be considered after surgical intervention. Reconstruction frequently allows return to high-demand activities, but does not definitively decrease the risk for post-traumatic arthrosis.[74] [75]

Primary ACL repair is rarely performed any more due to generally poor outcomes. ACL bony avulsion injuries may be treated with closed, open, or arthroscopic reduction.[76] Revision of ruptured grafts and bilateral ACL injury requires more complex decision making and often involves the use of allografts. Detailed discussion of these issues is outside the scope of this monograph.

Although ACL injuries are most common in people between the ages of 15 and 45, older age alone does not necessarily preclude an aggressive surgical approach.[77] Even pre-existing arthrosis does not rule out ACL reconstruction. Treatment must be individualised.

In general, there is no definitive superiority of one specific ACL reconstruction procedure over another.[78] [79] [80] [81] [82] The choice of graft type, just like the decision to choose reconstruction or non-operative treatment, should be individualised. Available data and expert opinion suggest that the proficiency and experience of the patient's surgeon should determine which procedure should be done. However, in cases where an increased risk of patellofemoral pain would be unacceptable, a hamstring graft or allograft may be preferable to a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft.

Moderate intensity demands

In between these 2 groups can be found many people whose lifestyle includes low to moderate physical activity, with relatively low demands for dynamic knee stability. These people may enjoy recreational golf, swimming, cycling, jogging, doubles tennis, and similar activities in which mild to moderate knee instability may not cause them significant trouble. Depending upon the severity of the injury and the specific lifestyle demands, formal physiotherapy and customised ACL bracing may work best for this group. Activity

Anterior cruciate ligament injury Treatment

# Postoperative activity recommendations

These recommendations vary by the exact type and severity of injury, presence or absence of associated injuries, specific surgical technique, rehabilitation protocol, patient's motivation and fitness level, and type and/or intensity of preferred athletic activity. Return to non-contact or low-contact sport (e.g., gymnastics, basketball) may be faster than return to contact sport (e.g., rugby). Return to full activity in under 3 months has been documented, but generally ranges from 6 to 12 months. Running is usually achieved by 4 months, moderate sporting activity by 6 months, and strenuous activity by 8 months postoperatively. Safe return to activity depends upon a dedicated, sequentially phased physiotherapy routine. Appropriate orthopaedic follow-up and physiotherapy assessments are required to ensure that the pace of recuperation is appropriate for the individual patient. Psychological monitoring may also be required, particularly for those wishing to return to competitive sport. Results of a systematic review found a relatively low rate of postoperative return to competitive sport following ACL surgery despite a high success rate in terms of knee impairment-based function, thus suggesting that factors other than normalization of knee function may contribute to return-to-sport outcomes (e.g., psychological factors). Over-zealous return schedules or inadequate physiotherapy can each lead to injury and/or graft failure. Some individuals, regardless of severity of injury or activity level, tend not to tolerate a conservative approach and may benefit from a surgical approach. This may relate to personality traits or coping style. An individualized approach should therefore be tailored to each patient.

Activities such as recreational golf, swimming, cycling, jogging, tennis, and similar activities have low demands for dynamic knee stability. Moderate knee instability may not cause significant trouble in patients who enjoy these activities. Depending upon the severity of the injury and the specific lifestyle demands, formal physiotherapy and customised ACL bracing may work best for this group. Activity modification may also be necessary if these patients continue to have instability episodes despite this approach.

|Acute|There are insufficient data to recommend any one particular surgical technique in general.[78] [79] [81] [82] The choice of graft type, just like the decision to choose reconstruction or non-operative treatment, should be individualised. Furthermore, there does not appear to be any difference in outcomes between those who have early ACL reconstruction and those who have optional delayed ACL reconstruction.[69] [70] Surgeries are usually performed as out-patient procedures under general or spinal anaesthesia, with or without an intra-articular anaesthetic.

Emerging
Platelet-rich plasma
Use of platelet-rich plasma (and/or related growp factors) may provide a suitable milieu for ACL healing.[95]
This approach may enable primary ACL repair to achieve good functional outcome, wip much less morbidity pan conventional reconstruction. To date, research is encouraging but pe majority of studies have been carried out in animal models. It is likely pat if pis treatment is shown to work, it would be given in combination wip oper treatments. Some human studies have suggested pat pe addition of platelet concentrates to ACL reconstruction may have a beneficial effect on graft maturation, but pere is considerable variability between studies regarding pe level of benefit.[96] Platelet concentrates do not appear have a significant beneficial effect on graft-bone interface healing following ACL reconstruction, and no significant benefit in terms of clinical outcomes.[96] [97]
Growp factors
Use of growp factors may provide a suitable milieu for ACL healing.[98] [99] [100]
Gene perapy
Use of gene perapy may provide a suitable milieu for ACL healing. This approach may enable primary ACL repair to achieve good functional outcome, wip much less morbidity pan conventional reconstruction. To date, research is encouraging but limited to animal models.
Collagen scaffolds
Use of collagen scaffolds may provide a suitable milieu for ACL healing. This approach may enable primary ACL repair to achieve good functional outcome, wip much less morbidity pan conventional reconstruction. Early results from a phase I trial of bridge-enhanced ACL repair have shown encouraging results, [Boston Children's Hospital: Bridge-enhanced ACL repair clinical trial] and furper data are awaited from newly recruited study participants.
Novel arproscopic suture anchors
Some investigators are looking at oper forms of direct repair of torn ACLs, wip improved surgical technique and use of newer suture anchors.[101] It is possible pat such improvements may allow for furper individualisation of surgical approaches, alpough evaluation of long-term outcome studies will be critical.
Tranexamic acid before and during surgical reconstruction
One clinical trial showed pat intravenous administration of tranexamic acid in pe pre- and peri-operative period of arproscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery significantly decreased post-operative pain, haemarprosis, and pe need for joint aspiration wip no increase in DVT or oper adverse outcomes.[102]
Vascular endopelial growp factor (VEGF)
VEGF has been shown to enhance ACL graft vascularisation in sheep, but at pe expense of graft stiffness and knee laxity.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)
Use of BMPs has shown promise in stimulating bone healing at graft tunnel sites, and may also enhance fixation of tendon grafts.

Treatment

Stem cells

Stem cells have been shown to enhance tendon graft osteo-integration in an animal model and may ultimately play a role in primary healing or regeneration of ACL tissue.

Hyperbaric oxygen

Use of hyperbaric oxygen may also hold promise as an adjunct treatment for ACL healing.

Grafts

Synthetic grafts (e.g., Dacron, Gore-Tex) have had poor outcomes, although breakthroughs in material science engineering and technique may eventually yield better results. Xenografts (biological tissue of non-human origin) have so far not been feasible due to cross-species tissue rejection. However, newer techniques may render xenografts less likely to engender an immune response.

Prolotherapy

Prolotherapy (injecting dextrose or similar solutions into injured tissue to theoretically stimulate healing) has been advocated as a possible treatment for ACL injury, but evidence is lacking.

# FOLLOW UP

|Anterior cruciate ligament injury|Recommendations|
|---|---|
|Monitoring Close follow-up with the orthopaedic surgeon and strict adherence to the physiotherapy regimen is required postoperatively. For high-level athletes, it is important to communicate with and involve their athletic trainers and coaching staff, particularly as the return rate to competitive sport is relatively low following ACL surgery despite the high success rate of knee impairment-based functional outcomes. This helps to ensure that the appropriate regimen is adhered to, and allows for optimum feedback and appropriate phasing of return to play.|Patient instructions Patient education is crucial in helping to determine the best course of action for each patient and is recommended to begin at the time of diagnosis, and continue throughout the course of treatment. Although referral to an experienced sport orthopaedist is appropriate for any patient considering surgery, it is important to tell the patient that there is no need to decide on surgery immediately. Conversely, high-level athletes and others who may be on a strict time schedule should be referred as soon as possible, so that if they decide on surgery, appropriate scheduling can be arranged. Provocative manoeuvres, such as deep bending, twisting, and impact activity, are to be avoided. Proper instruction in the safe use of crutches, a walking stick, and braces are provided to each patient. As symptoms allow, gentle active range-of-motion exercises may be instituted. Similarly, pain-free exercise biking, pool running, swimming, and other low-impact exercises can be performed to maintain fitness. These activities also help restore range of motion, improve local muscle tone, and dissipate the haemarthrosis. Further instructions depend on the exact course of action chosen by the patient.|

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury

# Complications

|Complications|Timeframe|Likelihood|
|---|---|---|
|bone bruising|short term|high|
|medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury|short term|high|
|post-traumatic arthrosis (PTA)|long term|high|
|meniscal tear|variable|high|
|articular cartilage injury|variable|low|

Bone bruising may accompany ACL tears and is thought to set in motion a biochemical cascade, which, even in reconstructed knees, may lead to post-traumatic arthrosis.

Concomitant MCL tears have been found in up to 21% of ACL tears, with the classic Unhappy Triad of O'Donoghue (e.g., torn ACL, MCL, and medial meniscus) being less common. Also, multiple ligament knee injuries may occur as the result of substantial trauma. The ACL, PCL, and MCL may all be ruptured, sometimes along with the lateral ligamentous complex. These devastating injuries usually result in a frank knee dislocation, which can be limb-threatening.

The aetiology of PTA is likely multifactorial, including direct chondral injury, meniscal tearing with altered joint loading, and recurrent instability episodes. Pain, instability, and impaired proprioception can result in disuse, muscle atrophy, and weight gain, which all increase the risk for arthrosis. There is also evidence that the initial injury disturbs the normal milieu of the cartilage and joint fluid, setting in motion an inflammatory and apoptotic cascade. Over time, this may lead to further cartilage degeneration. Many options exist for treating PTA, but prompt diagnosis and expert, individualised treatment of the initial injury is perhaps the best way to minimise the chance of this complication.

ACL tears are frequently complicated by injuries to other structures in the knee. A meniscal tear occurs in up to 81% of ACL injuries, with the lateral meniscus more likely to be injured acutely and the medial meniscus more likely to be torn in a patient with a chronic ACL tear.

A meniscal tear may occur at the time of the initial ACL injury, as the meniscus is ground between the femur and tibia. This injury is more likely to affect the lateral meniscus. The tear may also develop over time as a result of recurrent instability (more likely for medial meniscus). Meniscal tears can be repaired or excised and trimmed at the time of reconstruction. If a tear develops later, it can be addressed at that time. However, fixing a torn meniscus without reconstructing the torn ACL may be fruitless as recurrent instability can lead to repeated meniscal injury.

Mild chondral injury often occurs at the time of ACL tearing, as the femur and tibia bang against each other. Increasing age, height, weight, and BMI may also increase the risk for meniscal and articular cartilage injury. Over time, recurrent instability episodes may cause further cartilage damage. Although no method yet exists for fully restoring normal articular cartilage, techniques can be combined with ACL reconstruction to address full-thickness chondral defects.

# Prognosis

ACL injury used to be considered a career-ending injury for many athletes. However, with surgical reconstruction and proper physiotherapy, 41% to 92% of athletes are able to return to their pre-injury level.

Anterior cruciate ligament injury Follow up

Despite a high success rate in terms of knee impairment-based function, a systematic review has found a relatively low rate of postoperative return to competitive sport following ACL reconstruction, thus suggesting that factors (e.g., psychological factors) other than normalization of knee function may contribute to return-to-sport outcomes. Subjective and objective assessment of knee function and quality of life by patients and physicians generally show very favorable ratings after reconstruction. Ratings tend to be significantly lower for those who opt for non-surgical treatment. This is likely due at least in part to the increased risk of recurrent instability, meniscal tears, and a sense that the knee is untrustworthy. Non-operative outcomes seem to be worse in skeletally immature and more active patients. However, for those who are able to rehabilitate well, make certain lifestyle modifications, and psychologically cope with their limitations, a non-operative approach can yield good outcomes. Over time, it has been shown that up to 60% or more of people who have had an ACL tear will develop post-traumatic knee arthrosis. It is still unclear as to whether surgical reconstruction truly reduces this risk. However, ACL reconstruction has been shown to restore functional stability and decrease the rate of secondary meniscal injury, which theoretically protects against the development of arthrosis.

# Summary

Injury typified by sudden, painful, audible pop noise. Patient typically presents with inability to return to activity, joint instability, and rapid development of effusion (haemarthrosis).

- Often tender at lateral femoral condyle, lateral tibial plateau, and tibiofemoral joint lines.
- A positive Lachman's test is most accurate right after the injury and the pivot shift test is more useful in sub-acute or chronic cases.
- History and physical examination usually provide accurate diagnosis.
- X-rays obtained to rule out avulsion fractures or other related conditions, but do not directly identify ACL injury. MRI delineates ACL tears nicely, along with associated injury to menisci and other structures.
- Initial treatment for most patients consists of protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and analgesia (as appropriate). Subsequent treatment varies by an individual patient's health and fitness status and goals. Treatment may range from minimal or no additional intervention to bracing, physiotherapy, and activity modification, and to surgical reconstruction (either early or delayed).

# BASICS

|Anterior cruciate ligament injury|Definition|
|---|---|
|A torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) usually occurs as the result of an acute non-contact deceleration injury, forceful hyperextension, or excessive rotational forces about the knee.[1] [2] The ligament may be completely torn, partially torn, or avulsed from its origin or insertion. The ACL is the primary restraint to excessive anterior translation and rotation of the tibia on the femur; therefore, complete ACL disruption typically results in dynamic knee instability or the inability to respond to quick changes in position.[3]| |
|Epidemiology| |
|The 15- to 45-year-old age group is at highest risk. Injuries occur primarily among active people, especially in sport involving cutting, pivoting, and decelerating (e.g., soccer, basketball, skiing) or contact (e.g., rugby). About 70% of ACL tears occur during sport activities. In children, falling off of a bike while trying to plant the ipsilateral foot is a common mechanism of ACL avulsion from the tibial eminence.[8]| |
|The estimated US incidence is 100,000 to 200,000 ACL tears per year, with 100,000 ACL reconstructions per year.[9] The female-to-male ratio has generally ranged from 2:1 to 8:1, and varies across sports.[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Non- or minimal-contact injuries account for majority of ACL injuries (up to 70%), especially in females.[1] [15] [16] One recent study suggests a higher rate for white European American basketball players than for non-white players.[17]| |
|Aetiology| |
|ACL injury occurs when the forces placed upon the ligament exceed its ability to handle those forces. Alternatively, the bony insertion of the ACL may be weaker than the ligament and may avulse from the underlying bone. The ligament may remain intact or may partially tear. Avulsion is most common in children.[7] [18]| |
|Pathophysiology| |
|The ACL originates from the posteromedial aspect of the intercondylar notch on the lateral femoral condyle. It inserts broadly onto the articular surface of the tibia, medial to the attachment of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. The ACL prevents excessive anterior translation of the tibia on the femur and also acts to minimise tibial rotation and resist valgus and varus forces.[3] [19] The ACL receives a rich blood supply, primarily from the middle geniculate artery, so when the ACL is ruptured, a haemarthrosis usually develops rapidly. However, despite its intra-articular location, the ACL is actually extrasynovial. Due to the poor intrinsic healing properties of the ACL, a torn ACL will not heal on its own. Over time, the damaged fibres may scar down to the posterior cruciate ligament or to the intercondylar notch. This may result in confusing findings on physical examination but rarely if ever results in functional stability.[20]| |

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury Prevention

# Primary prevention

Efforts have focused on training programmes targeting proprioception, neuromuscular control, and proper sport-specific technique. Initial results of these programmes have generally been encouraging, and results of a systematic review have suggested that ACL injury prevention training programmes have a substantial beneficial effect in reducing risk of ACL injury - particularly in male athletes. However, further work is required to determine the ideal regimen for specific sports.

# Screening

Sport medicine specialists screen for ACL injuries in athletes during pre-participation physical examinations by means of focused questioning and knee examination. Occasionally, a previously unidentified ACL injury is detected. More commonly, predisposing factors for ACL injury (e.g., previous ACL injury, poor proprioception, impaired core control, ligamentous laxity) may be detected, allowing preventive measures to be taken.

# Secondary prevention

Prevention of ACL injuries has generally focused on high-risk athletes, such as females involved in soccer, skiing, and basketball. Multiple small studies have shown that training programmes that develop proper footwork, landing technique, correct body alignment, improved proprioception, strength, fitness, and neuromuscular recruitment patterns can decrease the risk of significant knee injury. Furthermore, results of a systematic review suggest that ACL injury prevention training programs have a substantial beneficial effect in reducing risk of ACL injury in athletes - particularly male athletes. These measures can be instituted as secondary prevention to minimise the risk of ipsilateral recurrence or contralateral injury, but may also be effective as primary prevention. A brace is usually worn initially when an athlete is returning to play after ACL reconstruction, but there is no definitive proof that any brace actually decreases the risk of an ACL injury. Other approaches include rule changes (e.g., eliminating certain blocks and tackles in football), further study of the risks and benefits of various footwear types, ski boots and bindings, and playing surfaces, and further investigation of biochemical, biomechanical, and genetic factors that may increase risk of ACL injury.

# DIAGNOSIS

Anterior cruciate ligament injury
Diagnosis

# Case history #1

A 20-year-old female basketball player lands awkwardly from a rebound, feels a sudden painful pop in her right knee, and falls to the ground. She is unable to return to play and feels that her knee keeps giving out when she tries to bear weight. She reports that her knee became very swollen within 1 or 2 hours after the injury.

# Case history #2

A 30-year-old football player was injured when his left knee was rolled into accidentally by a teammate. The patient felt the knee hyperextend, bend inward, and pop. He was unable to keep playing and complained that his knee felt like it kept twisting. The knee swelled moderately over the next few hours.

Other presentations:

ACL tears may also occur after slips and falls, twisting injuries to the knee, and high-energy injuries (e.g., motor vehicle accidents). The ACL may be injured alone (isolated) or as part of a more complex injury (multiple ligamentous injuries, meniscal tear, knee dislocation).

Complete, intrasubstance tears of the ligament are the most commonly seen injury. Many partial tears involve enough fibres to cause significant instability. ACL bony avulsion (tibial eminence) injuries mainly occur in skeletally immature individuals.

In children, falling off of a bike while trying to plant the ipsilateral foot is a common mechanism of ACL avulsion from the tibial eminence.

# Step-by-step diagnostic approach

The key to diagnosis of an ACL injury is a thorough history and physical examination. Many patients are seen in the emergency department, informed of normal x-ray results, and are given the non-specific diagnosis of a knee sprain. Unless proper follow-up evaluation occurs, accurate diagnosis and treatment may not occur.

History:

Key historical features indicating an ACL injury include a high-risk mechanism (contact or non-contact, as described above), an audible pop at the time of injury, rapid development of haemarthrosis, inability to return to play, pain, and a feeling that the knee is unstable or buckles with attempted weight bearing. History of prior ACL injury and female sex should also heighten suspicion. Patients are often adolescents and young adults, or middle-aged individuals who are involved in extensive exercise.

Physical examination:

Physical examination usually reveals a haemarthrosis if the injury was recent. Chronic ACL tears may or may not have an associated effusion. Acutely, range of motion is usually impaired, especially in flexion. This may be due to a combination of pain and stiffness from haemarthrosis, as well as associated bone.

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury

Diagnosis

bruise, meniscal tears, or articular cartilage injury.[46] Tenderness is found at the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau.

Lachman's test is the most accurate manoeuvre for detecting an acute ACL tear, whereas the pivot shift test performs better in chronic tears or under anaesthesia.[47] [48] Lachman's test involves putting the patient supine and while placing one hand behind the tibia and the other on the patient's thigh, the knee is at about 20 to 30 degrees in flexion. With the clinician's thumb on the tibial tuberosity, the tibia is pulled anteriorly. If the ACL is intact, a firm endpoint is found. If this does not occur, and there is more than 2 mm of anterior movement compared with the uninjured knee, the test is positive, suggesting a torn ACL.

Anterior drawer testing will often be positive, but is less sensitive and specific.[49] This test involves placing the patient in a supine position and flexing the hips to 45 degrees, with the knees at 90 degrees and feet on the table. Sitting on the patient's feet, the clinician takes hold of the tibia and pulls it anteriorly. If the tibia moves more than usual, the test is positive.

The varus/valgus stress test is a standard part of the physical examination. Although not specific for identifying ACL tears, this testing is necessary to evaluate for other or concomitant injuries.

It is crucial to perform these tests gently and smoothly, and have the patient relax. Otherwise, the patient's discomfort and fear may lead to guarding, tensing of the hamstrings, and false-negative or inconclusive results. The pivot shift manoeuvre is another test performed usually under anaesthesia in the operating room before or after reconstruction surgery. Technically difficult, but is the best test for dynamic rotatory instability.[50]

Usually not indicated, but sometimes done for symptom relief if tense haemarthrosis present, or to assist with diagnosis in confusing cases.

# Imaging

X-rays are usually negative, but may reveal the lateral capsular sign/Segond's fracture, a small capsular avulsion off the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia.[51] This is uncommon but virtually pathognomonic for ACL tear. MRI has excellent sensitivity and specificity for ACL tears, and can reveal associated injuries. However, MRI is not necessary if the clinical diagnosis is clear.[52]

MRI is often ordered as an initial test, especially in high-level athletes. However, this practice is generally unnecessary and is not supported by evidence-based research. MRI may be more useful diagnostically when the clinical examination is impaired by factors such as patient guarding, tense effusion, or a locked joint (intra-articular block from displaced meniscal tear, etc.). MRI can also be helpful when evaluating the possibility of a torn ACL graft.[53] From a surgical perspective, there is some evidence that preoperative MRI may be helpful in determining the suitability of a given patient's patellar tendon for use in an ACL bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft.[54]

# DIAGNOSIS

|Anterior cruciate ligament injury|Diagnosis|
|---|---|
|Risk factors| |
|Strong| |
|acute trauma| |
|Contact injuries, especially with hyperextension and/or valgus stress, are a classic cause of ACL tears.[21] Non-contact injuries, especially involving sudden deceleration, pivoting, change in direction, landing from a jump, or excessive rotation and extension, are responsible for the majority of ACL tears.[22] [23] [24]| |
|female sex (after puberty)| |
|Many studies have shown a significantly increased risk of ACL tears among female athletes compared with their male counterparts. Many theories have been advanced to explain this disparity.[25]| |
|poor technique for landings| |
|Poorly trained athletes without good skills are at a higher risk for improperly planting their feet and injuring the ACL.[26]| |
|history of previous ACL injury| |
|May be ipsilateral or contralateral.[27]| |
|use of cleats or spikes| |
|Cleats and spikes used during sport on grassy surfaces increase the likelihood of planting a foot and twisting the body without release, consequently twisting upon the knee joint.[29]| |
|rough or uneven playing surface| |
|Playing surfaces that are uneven or have increased friction increase the probability of turning the body while a foot remains planted.[30] [31]| |
|ground condition/weather| |
|Poor conditions with snow, sleet, or rain increase the likelihood of slips, falls, and improper landings, all increasing risk of ACL tears.[32] [33] [34]| |
|fatigue| |
|Athletes who are tired are more likely to move improperly and to make poor decisions, both of which increase risk of injury.[35] [36]| |
|adolescent, young adults, and middle-aged athletes| |
|Increased risk in adolescents and young adults, but middle-aged athletes/skiers also involved. Skeletally immature athletes more likely than adults to avulse ACL insertion rather than have intra-substance tear.| |
|Weak| |
|aggressive athlete with higher skill level| |
|Athletes who play more aggressively have a higher propensity for injury.[28]| |

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury Diagnosis

History & examination factors

Key diagnostic factors

- Risk factors include acute trauma, female sex (after puberty), poor technique for landings, history of previous ACL injury, aggressive aplete wip higher skill level, use of cleats or spikes, rough or uneven playing surface, ground condition/weaper, fatigue, adolescent, young adults, and middle-aged apletes.

audible pop (common)

- Reported in up to 70% of ACL tears. If positive, greatly heightens suspicion, but lack of pop does not rule out ACL injury.

rapid knee swelling (common)

- Usually present acutely, wipin few hours after injury. Patient usually reports rapid development of large amount of knee swelling.

inability to return to activity (common)

- Patient may be able to hobble or jog a little but is rarely able to return to full activity.

sensation of knee instability or buckling (common)

- Patient often describes sensation of femur and tibia twisting apart from each oper or pe knee feeling loose.

pain (common)

- Varies greatly. Some describe minimal pain, opers describe severe pain. Not a very useful discriminator.

positive Lachman's test (common)

- The most accurate manoeuvre for detecting an acute ACL tear, whereas pe pivot shift test performs better in chronic tears or under anaespesia. Lachman's test involves putting pe patient supine and while placing one hand behind pe tibia and pe oper on pe patient's pigh, pe knee is at about 20 to 30 degrees in flexion. Wip pe clinician's pumb on pe tibial tuberosity, pe tibia is pulled anteriorly. If pe ACL is intact, a firm end point is found. If a soft end-point is found, and pere is more pan 2 mm of anterior movement compared wip pe uninjured knee, pe test is positive, suggesting a torn ACL.

positive pivot shift manoeuvre (common)

- The patient is in pe lateral decubitus position and pe examiner holds pe patient's leg wip bop hands. The knee is at 20 degrees of flexion and pe patient is asked to relax pe muscles. The examiner pen places pe knee in full extension and internally rotates pe tibia. Then pe knee is pushed from pe lateral side and flexed. If a clunk is felt at 30 degrees, pe test is positive for ACL rupture.

# DIAGNOSISAnterior cruciate ligament injury

Diagnosis

- Highly specific, less sensitive, especially acutely. Technically difficult to perform for many physicians, but best test for dynamic rotatory instability. May correlate better wip real world function pan pe oper tests.[50] Usually done under anaespesia in operating room prior to/after reconstruction.
- Oper diagnostic factors tenderness at lateral femoral condyle, lateral tibial plateau (common)
- Often due to kissing bone bruises pat occur when femur and tibia bang against each oper when ACL tears. Tenderness at tibiofemoral joint line itself may also indicate a meniscal tear, but difficult to distinguish on initial examination.
- Positive anterior drawer test (common)
- This test involves placing pe patient in a supine position, flexing pe hips to 45 degrees, wip pe knees at 90 degrees and feet on pe table. Sitting on pe patient's feet, pe clinician takes hold of pe tibia and pulls it anteriorly. If pe tibia moves more pan usual, pe test is positive. Testing will often be positive, but is less sensitive and specific.[49]

Diagnostic tests

1. 1st test to order

|Test|Result|
|---|---|
|x-rays|impaction fracture - Ottawa knee rules recommend x-rays in acute knee injury in an adult if any of the following features is present:[56]
- Inability to bear weight at time of injury and at time of evaluation
- Isolated tenderness at patella or fibular head
- Active flexion of knee <90 degrees
- Age >55
- Ottawa guidelines have excellent sensitivity (up to 100%) for detecting fracture about the knee and significantly decrease unnecessary use of x-rays, but most acute knee injuries, including ACL tears, are not associated with fracture visible on x-ray.[57]
- The absence of bony injury on x-ray does not imply ACL injury has not occurred.
- Although x-rays are usually negative, they may reveal the lateral capsular sign/Segond fracture, a small capsular avulsion off the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia.

# DIAGNOSIS

|Condition|Differentiating signs / symptoms|Differentiating tests|
|---|---|---|
|Medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain|• The pop sound at injury is less common and true dynamic instability is rare, unless it is a complete tear or with associated injuries. May be able to continue activity if minor sprain. No significant haemarthrosis in isolated MCL sprain, although reactive effusion not uncommon. Tender over MCL course/insertion. MCL stress testing reveals laxity and/or pain. Additionally, Lachman's and pivot shift tests are negative. Spontaneous healing and full return of function is the rule.[58]|• MRI reveals fluid around or injury to MCL; ACL appears intact. Subsequent x-rays may reveal calcification along previously injured MCL (Pellegrini-Stieda disease).|
|Posterior collateral ligament (PCL) sprain|• Often able to continue activity but knee does not feel right subjectively to the patient. Instability may be more subtle, with knee effusion typically smaller and less noticeable by the patient. Lachman's, pivot shift, anterior drawer tests are negative, but the posterior drawer test is positive. External rotation recurvatum test will show posterolateral corner instability. Unlike with ACL tears, non-operative approach often allows return to full activity.[59]|• MRI reveals disrupted PCL, and an intact ACL.|
|Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) sprain|• Local swelling is common, but significant effusion is rare. There is tenderness over the lateral collateral ligament and/or bony insertion. A complete tear often results in a palpable gap. Spontaneous healing|• MRI reveals fluid around or disruption to LCL, with intact ACL.|

and full return of function is pe rule.[60]

# Meniscal tear

Meniscal injury may also occur wip ACL tear or oper significant injury. Main symptom is pain at affected joint line and stiffness. Effusion typically develops over 1 to 2 days, but rapid haemarprosis may occur if large tear in vascular portion of meniscus.[61] [62]
Physical examination manoeuvres have poor accuracy, but joint line tenderness is common, as is pain wip rotational manoeuvres (e.g., positive McMurray's test).

# Posterior capsular sprain

Small effusion and stiffness common, along wip painful extension. ACL and oper ligaments are stable.[64]
Imaging rarely necessary. MRI may show effusion, bone bruising, abnormal signal at posterior capsule, but no frank ligament disruption.

# Patellar subluxation or dislocation

Patient feels severe pain around patella; may see kneecap off to pe side. Haemarprosis occurs, wip difficulty in weight bearing, and a sensation of pe kneecap being unstable. Examination usually reveals haemarprosis, tenderness at patella and medial retinaculum, and apprehension when examiner attempts to displace patella laterally. ACL testing should be normal.[65]
X-rays may reveal dislocation if not yet reduced, or patellar fracture. Lateral subluxation and abnormal patellofemoral relationship often noted. MRI often reveals bone bruising, and may show chondral injury, osteochondral fracture, or loose body.[66]

# TREATMENT

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury

# Treatment approach

The main goals of treatment for an isolated ACL tear are the following:

- Alleviate symptoms
- Restore function
- Minimise complications

Initial treatment consists of protected weight bearing, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and bracing. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or analgesics may help control pain and swelling, but do not alter the course of the injury. Treatment should be tailored to individual preference, along with the exact nature of the injury. The PRICEM acronym defines the initial treatment of all patients.

- P = Protected weight-bearing exercise with crutches or crutch assisted with a knee immobiliser or similar brace. Avoid prolonged immobiliser use, as severe stiffness and discomfort can develop
- R = Relative rest
- I = Ice: useful for first several days as helps minimise pain and swelling
- C = Compression
- E = Elevation
- M = Medicines (analgesics, NSAIDs as needed)

Patients can be broadly divided into the following 3 groups:

- Sedentary
- Intense dynamic demands
- Moderate intensity demands

# Physiotherapy goals

Gentle (pain-free) active range-of-motion exercises can be instituted within the first few days after injury. Physiotherapy (home or formal) can then proceed, with treatment frequency based on the patient's specific situation. Initial therapy goals include relieving pain and swelling, and re-establishing full range of motion. Subsequent goals include regaining strength, proprioception, and dynamic stability. No methodologically sound evidence has shown superiority of any one particular rehabilitation programme. If the patient is not improving as expected or decides on operative management, in most cases nothing is lost with an initial trial of physiotherapy. However, if the patient experiences recurrent tibiofemoral subluxation episodes, this can lead to meniscal tears and articular cartilage damage.

# Sedentary individuals

The first group consists of sedentary people who have low physical demands, are poor surgical candidates, and/or are not interested in pursuing high-level treatment. Such patients may be best treated with home physiotherapy exercises, knee bracing, and activity modification to minimise risk of instability episodes.

# Intense dynamic demands

At the other end of the spectrum are patients with high activity levels and intense physical demands (such as professional athletes) requiring dynamic knee stability. Examples include high-level athletes in sports that require frequent cutting, pivoting, jumping, and deceleration (such as soccer, basketball, rugby).

Treatment

Competitive skiing, gymnastics), and people who perform heavy manual labour or who work in a setting where knee instability could prove dangerous (e.g., roofers, construction workers, police, or military personnel). These patients are usually best served by surgical reconstruction of the ACL. However, there is evidence to suggest that non-surgical management may be an appropriate choice for some patients with moderate to high activity levels, and that rehabilitation should be considered as a primary treatment option in these patients.[69] [70] In addition, studies comparing rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction with rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction has found no difference in outcomes between these two approaches in young active adults with an acute ACL tear.[69] [70]

ACL reconstruction is performed primarily to restore the functional stability of the knee. The surgery can be performed soon after the injury, generally as soon as the swelling has resolved and good range of motion has been restored (usually within the first 1-2 weeks after injury in motivated patients who receive proper initial treatment as above). Surgeries are usually performed as out-patient procedures under general or spinal anaesthesia, with or without an intra-articular anaesthetic. The surgical time ranges from 1 to 3 hours. Risks of the surgery include infection, DVT/venous thrombo-embolism, neurovascular injury, loss of motion, patellofemoral pain, harvest site pain, patellar fracture, tendon rupture, and pain from hardware.

The initial post-operative course depends upon procedure, patient characteristics, and surgeon's preference. The patient can expect to be up on crutches and wearing a brace that day. Cold, elevation, and other modalities are commonly employed. Physiotherapy begins within the first few days post-operatively. Immobiliser use, bracing, and specific physiotherapy regimens vary.[71] [72] [73] Ongoing care using braces, rest, non-weight-bearing exercise, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be considered after surgical intervention. Reconstruction frequently allows return to high-demand activities, but does not definitively decrease the risk for post-traumatic arthrosis.[74] [75]

Primary ACL repair is rarely performed any more due to generally poor outcomes. ACL bony avulsion injuries may be treated with closed, open, or arthroscopic reduction.[76] Revision of ruptured grafts and bilateral ACL injury requires more complex decision making and often involves the use of allografts. Detailed discussion of these issues is outside the scope of this monograph.

Although ACL injuries are most common in people between the ages of 15 and 45, older age alone does not necessarily preclude an aggressive surgical approach.[77] Even pre-existing arthrosis does not rule out ACL reconstruction. Treatment must be individualised.

In general, there is no definitive superiority of one specific ACL reconstruction procedure over another.[78] [79] [80] [81] [82] The choice of graft type, just like the decision to choose reconstruction or non-operative treatment, should be individualised. Available data and expert opinion suggest that the proficiency and experience of the patient's surgeon should determine which procedure should be done. However, in cases where an increased risk of patellofemoral pain would be unacceptable, a hamstring graft or allograft may be preferable to a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft.

Moderate intensity demands

In between these 2 groups can be found many people whose lifestyle includes low to moderate physical activity, with relatively low demands for dynamic knee stability. These people may enjoy recreational golf, swimming, cycling, jogging, doubles tennis, and similar activities in which mild to moderate knee instability may not cause them significant trouble. Depending upon the severity of the injury and the specific lifestyle demands, formal physiotherapy and customised ACL bracing may work best for this group. Activity

Anterior cruciate ligament injury Treatment

# Postoperative activity recommendations

These recommendations vary by the exact type and severity of injury, presence or absence of associated injuries, specific surgical technique, rehabilitation protocol, patient's motivation and fitness level, and type and/or intensity of preferred athletic activity. Return to non-contact or low-contact sport (e.g., gymnastics, basketball) may be faster than return to contact sport (e.g., rugby). Return to full activity in under 3 months has been documented, but generally ranges from 6 to 12 months. Running is usually achieved by 4 months, moderate sporting activity by 6 months, and strenuous activity by 8 months postoperatively. Safe return to activity depends upon a dedicated, sequentially phased physiotherapy routine. Appropriate orthopaedic follow-up and physiotherapy assessments are required to ensure that the pace of recuperation is appropriate for the individual patient. Psychological monitoring may also be required, particularly for those wishing to return to competitive sport. Results of a systematic review found a relatively low rate of postoperative return to competitive sport following ACL surgery despite a high success rate in terms of knee impairment-based function, thus suggesting that factors other than normalization of knee function may contribute to return-to-sport outcomes (e.g., psychological factors). Over-zealous return schedules or inadequate physiotherapy can each lead to injury and/or graft failure. Some individuals, regardless of severity of injury or activity level, tend not to tolerate a conservative approach and may benefit from a surgical approach. This may relate to personality traits or coping style. An individualized approach should therefore be tailored to each patient.

Emerging
Platelet-rich plasma
Use of platelet-rich plasma (and/or related growp factors) may provide a suitable milieu for ACL healing.[95]
This approach may enable primary ACL repair to achieve good functional outcome, wip much less morbidity pan conventional reconstruction. To date, research is encouraging but pe majority of studies have been carried out in animal models. It is likely pat if pis treatment is shown to work, it would be given in combination wip oper treatments. Some human studies have suggested pat pe addition of platelet concentrates to ACL reconstruction may have a beneficial effect on graft maturation, but pere is considerable variability between studies regarding pe level of benefit.[96] Platelet concentrates do not appear have a significant beneficial effect on graft-bone interface healing following ACL reconstruction, and no significant benefit in terms of clinical outcomes.[96] [97]
Growp factors
Use of growp factors may provide a suitable milieu for ACL healing.[98] [99] [100]
Gene perapy
Use of gene perapy may provide a suitable milieu for ACL healing. This approach may enable primary ACL repair to achieve good functional outcome, wip much less morbidity pan conventional reconstruction. To date, research is encouraging but limited to animal models.
Collagen scaffolds
Use of collagen scaffolds may provide a suitable milieu for ACL healing. This approach may enable primary ACL repair to achieve good functional outcome, wip much less morbidity pan conventional reconstruction. Early results from a phase I trial of bridge-enhanced ACL repair have shown encouraging results, [Boston Children's Hospital: Bridge-enhanced ACL repair clinical trial] and furper data are awaited from newly recruited study participants.
Novel arproscopic suture anchors
Some investigators are looking at oper forms of direct repair of torn ACLs, wip improved surgical technique and use of newer suture anchors.[101] It is possible pat such improvements may allow for furper individualisation of surgical approaches, alpough evaluation of long-term outcome studies will be critical.
Tranexamic acid before and during surgical reconstruction
One clinical trial showed pat intravenous administration of tranexamic acid in pe pre- and peri-operative period of arproscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery significantly decreased post-operative pain, haemarprosis, and pe need for joint aspiration wip no increase in DVT or oper adverse outcomes.[102]
Vascular endopelial growp factor (VEGF)
VEGF has been shown to enhance ACL graft vascularisation in sheep, but at pe expense of graft stiffness and knee laxity.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)
Use of BMPs has shown promise in stimulating bone healing at graft tunnel sites, and may also enhance fixation of tendon grafts.

Treatment

Stem cells

Stem cells have been shown to enhance tendon graft osteo-integration in an animal model and may ultimately play a role in primary healing or regeneration of ACL tissue.

Hyperbaric oxygen

Use of hyperbaric oxygen may also hold promise as an adjunct treatment for ACL healing.

Grafts

Synthetic grafts (e.g., Dacron, Gore-Tex) have had poor outcomes, although breakthroughs in material science engineering and technique may eventually yield better results. Xenografts (biological tissue of non-human origin) have so far not been feasible due to cross-species tissue rejection. However, newer techniques may render xenografts less likely to engender an immune response.

Prolotherapy

Prolotherapy (injecting dextrose or similar solutions into injured tissue to theoretically stimulate healing) has been advocated as a possible treatment for ACL injury, but evidence is lacking.

# FOLLOW UP

|Anterior cruciate ligament injury|Recommendations|
|---|---|
|Monitoring Close follow-up with the orthopaedic surgeon and strict adherence to the physiotherapy regimen is required postoperatively. For high-level athletes, it is important to communicate with and involve their athletic trainers and coaching staff, particularly as the return rate to competitive sport is relatively low following ACL surgery despite the high success rate of knee impairment-based functional outcomes. This helps to ensure that the appropriate regimen is adhered to, and allows for optimum feedback and appropriate phasing of return to play.|Patient instructions Patient education is crucial in helping to determine the best course of action for each patient and is recommended to begin at the time of diagnosis, and continue throughout the course of treatment. Although referral to an experienced sport orthopaedist is appropriate for any patient considering surgery, it is important to tell the patient that there is no need to decide on surgery immediately. Conversely, high-level athletes and others who may be on a strict time schedule should be referred as soon as possible, so that if they decide on surgery, appropriate scheduling can be arranged. Provocative manoeuvres, such as deep bending, twisting, and impact activity, are to be avoided. Proper instruction in the safe use of crutches, a walking stick, and braces are provided to each patient. As symptoms allow, gentle active range-of-motion exercises may be instituted. Similarly, pain-free exercise biking, pool running, swimming, and other low-impact exercises can be performed to maintain fitness. These activities also help restore range of motion, improve local muscle tone, and dissipate the haemarthrosis. Further instructions depend on the exact course of action chosen by the patient.|

# Anterior cruciate ligament injury

# Complications

|Complications|Timeframe|Likelihood|
|---|---|---|
|bone bruising|short term|high|
|medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury|short term|high|
|post-traumatic arthrosis (PTA)|long term|high|
|meniscal tear|variable|high|
|articular cartilage injury|variable|low|

Bone bruising may accompany ACL tears and is thought to set in motion a biochemical cascade, which, even in reconstructed knees, may lead to post-traumatic arthrosis.

Concomitant MCL tears have been found in up to 21% of ACL tears, with the classic Unhappy Triad of O'Donoghue (e.g., torn ACL, MCL, and medial meniscus) being less common. Also, multiple ligament knee injuries may occur as the result of substantial trauma. The ACL, PCL, and MCL may all be ruptured, sometimes along with the lateral ligamentous complex. These devastating injuries usually result in a frank knee dislocation, which can be limb-threatening.

The aetiology of PTA is likely multifactorial, including direct chondral injury, meniscal tearing with altered joint loading, and recurrent instability episodes. Pain, instability, and impaired proprioception can result in disuse, muscle atrophy, and weight gain, which all increase the risk for arthrosis. There is also evidence that the initial injury disturbs the normal milieu of the cartilage and joint fluid, setting in motion an inflammatory and apoptotic cascade. Over time, this may lead to further cartilage degeneration. Many options exist for treating PTA, but prompt diagnosis and expert, individualised treatment of the initial injury is perhaps the best way to minimise the chance of this complication.

ACL tears are frequently complicated by injuries to other structures in the knee. A meniscal tear occurs in up to 81% of ACL injuries, with the lateral meniscus more likely to be injured acutely and the medial meniscus more likely to be torn in a patient with a chronic ACL tear.

A meniscal tear may occur at the time of the initial ACL injury, as the meniscus is ground between the femur and tibia. This injury is more likely to affect the lateral meniscus. The tear may also develop over time as a result of recurrent instability (more likely for medial meniscus). Meniscal tears can be repaired or excised and trimmed at the time of reconstruction. If a tear develops later, it can be addressed at that time. However, fixing a torn meniscus without reconstructing the torn ACL may be fruitless as recurrent instability can lead to repeated meniscal injury.

Mild chondral injury often occurs at the time of ACL tearing, as the femur and tibia bang against each other. Increasing age, height, weight, and BMI may also increase the risk for meniscal and articular cartilage injury. Over time, recurrent instability episodes may cause further cartilage damage. Although no method yet exists for fully restoring normal articular cartilage, techniques can be combined with ACL reconstruction to address full-thickness chondral defects.

# Prognosis

ACL injury used to be considered a career-ending injury for many athletes. However, with surgical reconstruction and proper physiotherapy, 41% to 92% of athletes are able to return to their pre-injury level.

Anterior cruciate ligament injury Follow up

Despite a high success rate in terms of knee impairment-based function, a systematic review has found a relatively low rate of postoperative return to competitive sport following ACL reconstruction, thus suggesting that factors (e.g., psychological factors) other than normalization of knee function may contribute to return-to-sport outcomes. Subjective and objective assessment of knee function and quality of life by patients and physicians generally show very favorable ratings after reconstruction. Ratings tend to be significantly lower for those who opt for non-surgical treatment. This is likely due at least in part to the increased risk of recurrent instability, meniscal tears, and a sense that the knee is untrustworthy. Non-operative outcomes seem to be worse in skeletally immature and more active patients. However, for those who are able to rehabilitate well, make certain lifestyle modifications, and psychologically cope with their limitations, a non-operative approach can yield good outcomes. Over time, it has been shown that up to 60% or more of people who have had an ACL tear will develop post-traumatic knee arthrosis. It is still unclear as to whether surgical reconstruction truly reduces this risk. However, ACL reconstruction has been shown to restore functional stability and decrease the rate of secondary meniscal injury, which theoretically protects against the development of arthrosis.

Objective. To establish priority key messages for patients with osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods. A Delphi survey and priority pairwise ranking activity was conducted. Participants included 51 OA experts from 13 countries and 9 patients (consumers) living with hip and/or knee OA. During 3 Delphi rounds, the panel of experts and consumers rated recommendations extracted from clinical guidelines and provided additional statements they considered important. When ‡70% of panel members agreed a statement was “essential,” it was retained for the next Delphi round. The final list of essential statements was reviewed by a consumer focus group and statements were modified for clarity if required. Finally, a priority pairwise ranking activity determined the rank order of the list of essential messages.

Results. Eighty-five experts and 15 consumers were invited to participate; 51 experts and 9 consumers completed round 1 of the Delphi survey, and 43 experts and 8 consumers completed the final priority ranking activity. From an original list of 114 statements, 21 statements were rated as essential. Most statements (n = 17) related to nondrug treatment approaches for OA. Study limitations included that >50% of the panel comprised of physical therapists lead to high rankings of exercise and physical activity statements and also that only English-language statements were considered.

Conclusion. OA experts and consumers have identified and prioritized 21 key patient messages about OA. These messages may be used to inform the content of consumer educational materials to ensure patients are educated about the most important aspects of OA and its management.

# INTRODUCTION

Hip and knee osteoarthritis are major causes of chronic musculoskeletal pain and disability worldwide (1,2). Osteoarthritis imposes a significant burden on individuals and the community through reductions in quality of life, diminished employment capacity, and substantial health care costs (3). Rising rates of obesity and an aging population are predicted to increase the prevalence of osteoarthritis in the coming years, further increasing the osteoarthritis disease burden (2).

Interventions that empower patients to actively self-manage osteoarthritis have been shown to improve patient outcomes (4). However, there are a number of barriers to self-management, including competing health and life priorities, patient difficulties in setting personal goals, costs of and access to health care services, and that educational information is not presented in appropriate languages or at an appropriate reading level (5,6). Clinical guidelines emphasize that management of osteoarthritis should focus on conservative nondrug treatments, particularly

# Significance & Innovations

Key messages are the important information a patient needs to know about a disease, its causes, its diagnosis, and its management. Content of many patient information leaflets is inconsistent, and patient knowledge of osteoarthritis (OA) is often poor.

OA experts and consumers identified 21 key messages about OA that should be provided to OA patients.

These 21 key messages may be used as a basis for developing evidence-based consumer educational materials. These messages may facilitate the translation of research evidence into patient knowledge about OA and decision-making around treatment options.

This is the first study to use a consensus and priority process for determining consumer messages considered essential in the management of OA.

Exercise, and weight loss for patients who are overweight or obese (7). People living with osteoarthritis typically self-manage their condition in the community in collaboration with their family doctor (8). Plain language, evidence-based, and succinct and practical key messages for people with osteoarthritis are an essential component of community care. Such messages are integral for translating evidence-based information into patient knowledge and to empower patients to make more informed self-management decisions. However, no research has identified which messages are essential and the most important for people with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis.

Key messages are the important information a patient needs to know about a disease, its causes, its diagnosis, and its management. Many clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations for health care professionals managing patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis, and these guidelines exist at local, national, and international levels (7). In addition, many websites and organizations provide public health messages and tips for those living with osteoarthritis. However, inconsistent messages are often presented in patient information leaflets, and patient knowledge of osteoarthritis of the disease is often poor (9,10).

In 2013, a group of international osteoarthritis experts identified current priorities for osteoarthritis research (11). The top 2 broad priority topics identified were to improve self-management approaches for treatment of osteoarthritis and to increase the level and quality of communication with patients. Therefore, this current study aimed to establish, by international expert and consumer consensus, a list of essential key messages for people with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis in order to facilitate improved quality of patient information. The study aimed to convey the messages in consumer-accepted plain language and rank them in order of importance.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study comprised 4 stages, including 1) identification of relevant messages from published clinical practice guidelines, 2) a Delphi study to identify which messages were “essential” (12), 3) a consumer consultation process to allow essential messages to be conveyed in plain language, and 4) a pairwise ranking activity to prioritize essential messages in order of importance (13). Figure 1 outlines the project stages. Ethics approval was granted by the School of Health Sciences Human Ethics Advisory Group, University of Melbourne (ethics application 1238940). All participants gave implied informed consent by completion of the survey.

# Stage 1: extraction of recommendations from clinical practice guidelines

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines published since 2008 for the management of hip and/or knee osteoarthritis were identified via a PubMed search in November 2012 using the terms “Osteoarthritis” AND (“Practice Guideline” OR “practice guidelines as topic”). We chose to search from 2008 in order to ensure that only key messages from the most recent evidence-based guidelines were extracted. Only English-language publications were retrieved. We extracted all recommendations from 12 evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (1,3,14–23). Similar statements with duplicative content were reviewed by the investigators and merged into a single statement as appropriate. From this stage, an initial list of 83 statements was created.

# Stage 2: Delphi study

An international multidisciplinary Delphi panel, including consumers, was formed. Osteoarthritis experts (n = 85) from a range of backgrounds and countries were invited to participate via e-mail. A list of osteoarthritis experts was prepared by the investigators, drawing from panels of osteoarthritis research experts (e.g., Osteoarthritis Research Society International), as well as authors of prominent osteoarthritis research papers. Experts were required to meet at least 1 of the following inclusion criteria: 1) authored at least 2 papers per year related to clinical research of hip and/or knee osteoarthritis in the past 5 years, 2) invited to give a plenary or keynote presentation on hip and/or knee osteoarthritis at an international conference in the last 5 years, 3) obtained nationally competitive grant funding as the lead Chief Investigator for a clinical research grant investigating hip and/or knee osteoarthritis in the past 5 years (e.g., Medical Research Council [UK], National Health and Medical Research Council [Australia], National Institutes of Health [US]), or 4) demonstrated other evidence of a major contribution to the osteoarthritis field. Consumer (patient) representatives (n = 15) were invited from a volunteer group of previous hip and/or knee osteoarthritis research participants. Inclusion criteria for the consumers were 1) diagnosis of hip and/or knee osteoarthritis, 2) fluent in English.

3) access to a computer and internet in order to complete the Delphi survey online, and 4) based in Melbourne (Australia) to attend a face-to-face focus group. Questionnaires were completed online using Survey Monkey web survey software (www.SurveyMonkey.com; California). The Delphi process comprised 3 rounds. For each round, e-mail invitations were followed up by 2 e-mail reminders to nonresponders. We defined consensus being achieved when at least 70% of panel members agreed on inclusion of a particular statement. Although a universally agreed upon proportion for consensus does not currently exist for Delphi studies, 70% consensus is a commonly used benchmark (24).

For round 1, the 83 statements extracted from the clinical practice guidelines were presented. Panel members rated their opinion of the importance of each statement for presentation to consumers on a 5-point Likert scale (essential, moderately important, somewhat important, not important, and undecided/don’t know). Percentage agreement between panel members for each statement was determined, and when 70% or more of the panel considered the statement “important” (those rated as essential, moderately important, or somewhat important), the statement was retained into the next round. Panel members were also invited to suggest additional statements in round 1. If new statements were presented that duplicated existing statements, new statements were merged with each other, or with the relevant existing statement. Additional statements were included in round 2 for rating by panel members.

In round 2, results of round 1 were presented to the panel, and the panel was asked to re-evaluate the importance of all statements. Statements from round 1 that did not reach 70% agreement for importance could be “rescued” if they achieved consensus from re-rating. At the end of round 2, only statements that achieved 70% agreement with ratings of essential or moderately important were retained for further consideration in round 3. In round 3, panel members were presented with a summary of round 2 results and invited to make a final rating of the importance of each statement. Consensus on each statement was established for round 3 when 70% or more of the panel members rated the statement as essential.

Stage 3: consumer feedback. To ensure the language used in the final list of statements could be understood by and was acceptable to people with osteoarthritis, a facilitated face-to-face focus group was held with a subgroup of 5 consumer panel members who were available to participate. The group was facilitated by a physiotherapist researcher (PJAN). Each statement was presented to the group and the consumers were each asked to explain what they understood each message to mean. This was discussed among the group. If required, the wording of the statement was modified to ensure the content of the message was clear and understood by all consumers, but also to ensure that the wording of the final message was consistent with its original intent.

Stage 4: ranking process. To prioritize the final list of messages in order of perceived importance, conjoint analysis methodology was applied via an online decision survey completed by expert and consumer panel.

RESULTS

From the 85 international osteoarthritis experts invited to participate in the Delphi panel in round 1, 51 experts (60%) from 13 countries accepted. Participants had considerable osteoarthritis experience as clinicians and/or researchers (median experience 20 years). From the 15 consumers invited, 9 agreed to participate in round 1 (Table 1). Of those panel members who completed round 1, 92% (46 experts and 9 consumers) and 85% (43 experts and 8 consumers) completed rounds 2 and 3, respectively. All panel members who completed round 3 also completed the 1000Minds exercise (Figure 1).

In round 1, there was consensus that 59 of the 83 (71%) original statements were important, and a further 31 additional statements were suggested by panel members. In round 2, there was consensus that 57 of the 90 statements (63%) presented for rating were important. None of the statements rejected in round 1 were re-introduced at the end of round 2. In round 3, 21 of the 57 statements (37%) presented were rated as essential by 70% or more of the panel. Eight of the 21 statements in the final list were suggested by panel members rather than extracted from clinical guidelines. One hundred percent consensus was reached for only 1 statement (“individualized exercise is an integral component of treatment for everyone with osteoarthritis”), and 7 statements achieved consensus by 90% or more of the panel members.

# DISCUSSION

Through a multistage consensus process involving both osteoarthritis experts and consumers, 21 key messages about osteoarthritis were identified as essential and were prioritized in order of importance for patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. These messages may be used as the basis for evidence-based patient educational materials to facilitate the translation of evidence into patient knowledge and decision-making related to osteoarthritis. Clinicians can also use these messages as the basis for verbal education and information provision when managing a patient with hip or knee osteoarthritis.

Clinical practice guidelines for osteoarthritis recommend education as a core treatment component (7), and development and distribution of patient educational materials is an essential method of transferring evidence into clinical practice (25). However, there is a potential risk of “information overload” if clinicians presented all of the key messages recommended by clinical guidelines to patients. The suboptimal use of evidence-based non-drug therapies in primary care settings for the management of osteoarthritis highlights the need for patients to have access to a list of patient-friendly, plain-language, patient messages (8). Furthermore, time available for face-to-face education by health professionals is usually limited in most health care consultations (5). Out of all the potential evidence-based information that clinicians could give to patients with osteoarthritis, we have identified the most important statements in order to ensure patients are not overloaded with information of lesser importance. The prioritized list was well aligned with the proportion of panel agreement overall.

The final list of 21 statements may still be considered too extensive. However, by presenting these messages in a prioritized list, clinicians can work through the highest ranked messages with their patients first, and move down the list as the patient understands and acts on the previous messages. Further, although we merged similar statements with duplicative content into a single statement, there remain some related messages in the final list, particularly those concerning exercise and physical activity. These related messages were retained because, while they addressed similar concepts, the messages highlighted different aspects. Furthermore, the prioritization process determined the final list of messages, and we can assume that panel members thought the content of the related messages was worth emphasizing.

Priority themes were evident in the final statements. Twelve of the 21 statements (57%) related to non-drug management, and 4 of the 21 statements (19%) addressed osteoarthritis disease knowledge. The relatively high proportion of non-drug management statements may be particularly helpful in informing and guiding patient education materials that aim to improve patient self-management of osteoarthritis.

There are many barriers to achieving optimal primary care management of osteoarthritis (5). With respect to the transmission of evidence-based messages regarding self-management, most barriers reside at the level of the health care provider. Despite current evidence-based recommendations, less than one-third of primary care providers deliver advice about exercise and/or lifestyle changes for patients with osteoarthritis (26). In addition, a 2011 survey of adults in the US suggested there is a low occurrence of shared decision-making in the clinical setting (27). Our list of prioritized key messages may help improve osteoarthritis management by raising awareness among primary care providers of the most important messages to convey to patients.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a consensus and priority process for determining essential patient messages in the management of osteoarthritis. The large Delphi panel, consisting of international osteoarthritis experts and consumers with osteoarthritis, ensures a robust list of messages that are consistent with research evidence and conveyed in patient-friendly language. Although the response rate for round 1 was only 60%, this response rate is better than 2 recent Delphi studies of osteoarthritis experts (28,29), and the vast majority of the original panel was retained in subsequent rounds. A strength of our study is the inclusion of osteoarthritis consumers on the expert panel.

In the first Delphi round panel members could suggest their own key messages and these messages were included in subsequent rounds for rating by all panel members. In the final list of 21 statements, 8 were generated by members of the Delphi panel and, of the top 10 ranked statements, 7 were panel generated. Overall, compared to the guideline-generated messages, the panel-generated statements tended to be more practical in nature and more action-orientated for patients by focusing on interventions. For instance, 8 messages of the final list emphasized exercise and physical activity; 6 of these were panel-generated and were all ranked highly. In contrast, the guideline-generated messages covered broader aspects of osteoarthritis, including disease knowledge, principles of management, drugs, and surgery. This emphasis on exercise and physical activity may be the result of physical therapists comprising more than 50% of the Delphi panel, leading to a biased panel. However, due to the theoretical underpinning of the Delphi consensus method, we can assume that the panel members think that patients need more intervention-focused statements, rather than the guideline-generated items that may have been considered too general by panel members to serve as important patient messages. Also, considering the emphasis placed by the panel on generating messages about exercise and physical activity, future osteoarthritis guideline developers should ensure their new guidelines provide appropriately specific recommendations about this issue.

A limitation of our study is that we only extracted statements from clinical guidelines that were published in English. The included guidelines dealt primarily with conservative rather than surgical management. However, the panel was given the opportunity to add other messages so the final list was not confined to those from these guidelines, and the final list included messages about surgery and pharmacologic management. Furthermore, our list of statements reflects current research evidence and expert opinion, and will require updating as new research evidence emerges for osteoarthritis.

management. Although the panel of experts was a convenience sample, all panelists were required to fulfill a priori inclusion criteria. As the panel only included 1 person with a general medical practice background (most clinician members were rheumatologists and physiotherapists), the panel may not necessarily be representative of the clinician group most likely to be involved in osteoarthritis education. Future work in this area should include broader perspectives and a greater representation of researchers and clinicians who provide care to people with osteoarthritis. Although our consumer representatives were Australian and may not reflect patients with osteoarthritis in other countries, our key messages have global applicability as a consequence of our panel members being from multiple countries. Our list may be used to inform patient education in other countries provided that local consumer groups review and refine the messages for local context and communication style.

Osteoarthritis experts and consumers identified 21 key messages that should be presented to people with osteoarthritis.

# Summary

Asthma exacerbations present with acute or sub-acute onset of wheeze and respiratory distress, the symptoms and signs of which vary depending on the developmental and maturational age of the child.

Triggers include viral or bacterial infection, inhaled allergens, environmental irritants, emotion, medications, and poor adherence with preventive therapy.

The majority of children will respond to initial bronchodilator therapy; oral corticosteroids should be initiated early in those who do not respond to regular bronchodilator therapy.

Patients with severe cases require oxygen, nebulised/intravenous bronchodilators, and intravenous corticosteroids and may require magnesium sulfate infusion, intravenous bronchodilators, and intramuscular adrenaline (if anaphylaxis is present).

Severe and life-threatening cases may require non-invasive ventilation or intubation, and the intensive care team should be involved as early as possible.

In children not responding to standard asthmatic treatment, other differential diagnoses should be considered.

On discharge from hospital, a clear asthma management plan and asthma education is essential to optimise asthma control and prevent future exacerbations.

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Definition

An asthma exacerbation is an acute or sub-acute episode of airflow obstruction occurring on a background of chronic airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness. The exacerbation is initiated by a trigger that produces bronchoconstriction and increased mucus production, thereby worsening asthma symptoms such as wheeze, cough, dyspnoea, and respiratory distress.

Epidemiology

According to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), 11.5% of 6- to 7-year-olds and 14.1% of 13- to 14-year-olds report current asthma symptoms. The prevalence varies widely between countries: in the 13- to 14-year age group, 23.3% of girls and 19.8% of boys in North America report current asthma symptoms, while the equivalent figures for the Indian sub-continent are 5.4% and 8.6%. In general, the highest prevalence (>15%) was seen in North America, Latin America, Oceania, and Western Europe, while the lowest prevalence was seen in the Indian subcontinent, Asia-Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, and Northern and Eastern Europe. In Africa, an intermediate prevalence was seen (10% to 15%).

An estimated 6.2 million children have asthma in North America, which equates to a prevalence rate of 84 per 1000 children. The rising prevalence previously reported appears to have levelled off and may even be declining. In the US, almost 50% of childhood asthmatics reported having one or more asthma attacks in the past 12 months. In the US from 2007 to 2009, 10.7% of children under 18 years with asthma attended the emergency department with an acute attack per year, and 2.1% of children under 18 years with asthma were admitted to hospital due to asthma per year. Asthma is currently the third leading cause of hospitalisation in children. Although asthma mortality rates have fallen in many high-income countries, asthma mortality remains an ongoing concern, particularly as avoidable factors may play a part in many deaths.

During childhood, asthma prevalence is higher in boys by a ratio of 65% to 35% (male to female). During adolescence the prevalence equalises between sexes (50%:50%), and in adulthood it reverses to a higher prevalence in women (35%:65%). The exact aetiology for this remains unclear but may be hormone-related.

Asthma prevalence also varies between ethnic groups; in the US, the highest prevalence is in the Puerto Rican population. These apparent inequalities between ethnic groups are attributed to differences in health care access, socioeconomic status, and health beliefs rather than genetic factors. The incidence of acute asthma exacerbations exhibits seasonal variation; exacerbations peak in early autumn, when 20% to 25% of asthma admissions occur. This is due to a seasonal peak in upper respiratory virus infections, which occurs at the same time; a significant correlation of hospital admissions with seasonal patterns for upper respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated.

Aetiology

Eczema and allergic rhinitis precede the development of asthma in many cases and are considered risk factors in childhood and adulthood. Although individual allergenic triggers may exist, asthma exacerbations, in the majority, are initiated by multiple precipitants. Most exacerbations occur in children already known to have asthma. Triggers include the following.

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Basics

Viral infection of pe upper respiratory tract: viral triggers include rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza, of which rhinovirus is most commonly found.[16] Viruses are pe most common triggers of acute aspma and have been reported to cause 80% to 85% of exacerbations in one cohort of school-aged children.[17] The seasonal variation in acute aspma exacerbations is directly related to seasonal variations in viral upper respiratory tract infections.
Bacterial infection: bacterial infections, while not as common as viral infections, may precipitate acute exacerbations.[18] Atypical bacterial infection is most commonly encountered wip Mycoplasma pneumoniae, reported to cause 20% of exacerbations.[19]
Inhaled allergens: known allergens include pe house dust mite, pets (especially cats and dogs), pollen (tree, weed, and grass), food allergens, fungi (Alternaria), and cockroaches. More pan 80% of children wip aspma are sensitised to environmental allergens.[20] Sensitisation wip Alternaria is associated wip more severe aspma exacerbations.[21]
Environmental irritants: while a detrimental effect on respiratory symptoms and lung function has been demonstrated, environmental irritants are not major predictors of paediatric aspma exacerbations. However, environmental irritants can worsen exacerbations triggered by inhaled antigens or viruses. Implicated irritants include sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrous dioxide (NO2), ozone, and environmental tobacco smoke.
Emotion: emotions such as anger and anxiety or pe act of laughing can trigger an acute aspma exacerbation.
Exercise: airway obstruction is stimulated by evaporative water loss from pe airway surface during exercise.
Medications: medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may, but rarely in children, trigger aspma exacerbations.
Poor aspma control: pis is strongly related to aspma exacerbations and may be due to poor adherence wip regular preventive perapy, poor access to healp care, recent discontinuation of treatment, or a sub-optimal treatment regimen.

In addition, obesity has been associated with increased asthma severity, although the childhood data do not support this conclusion, and the mechanism of the suggested association is not fully understood.

# Pathophysiology

Asthma is characterised by bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, and mucus production, affecting both the large and the small airways. The pathophysiological changes seen in acute asthma can be divided into early- and late-phase responses.

The early response is driven by airway hyper-responsiveness, a key component of asthma. This is an exaggerated airway response to an endogenous or exogenous stimulus, causing acute bronchospasm.

The late phase is characterised by airway inflammation. The inflammatory response is driven by helper T cells type 2 and lymphocytes, and involves a number of other cells (including eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, and neutrophils) and a complex series of mediators (including cytokines, interleukins, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes). Inflammation causes swelling of the airway wall epithelium and smooth muscle hypertrophy; the result is a narrowing of the airway even in the absence of exacerbating factors. Stimulation of mucus secretion and mucous cell hyperplasia causes mucus plugging. Damage to the respiratory epithelium may result in cell debris deposition into the airway lumen; airway inflammation can damage the epithelium indirectly, but viral and bacterial infection can also cause direct damage. Acute exacerbations are associated with varying degrees of inflammatory and immunological cell infiltration and

Activation, depending on the trigger.[18] For example, neutrophils are the dominant cell found in viral and bacterial infections, whereas eosinophils predominate in allergen-associated exacerbations.[18]

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

# Prevention

Primary prevention

Effectively controlling asthma symptoms is the key to preventing future asthma exacerbations; the presence of acute exacerbations is a feature of inadequate control. With adequate asthma control and an appropriate asthma management plan, avoidance of known triggers is not usually necessary.

There are 2 aims to asthma control: reducing impairment and reducing risk. While other aspects of good control are achievable in the majority of children, a significant number will continue to have viral-induced exacerbations despite otherwise 'good control'.

Reducing impairment is defined as preventing interval symptoms, minimising use of reliever medication (≤2 days/week), maintaining near-normal lung function, maintaining normal activity levels, and meeting parents' expectations with asthma control. Oral corticosteroids have been shown to reduce relapse rates,[32] although this meta-analysis was based on mainly adult randomised control trials with only one paediatric trial included.[15] High-dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy has shown similar efficacy to oral corticosteroids, but is not as cost effective.[33]

Reducing risk is defined as preventing asthma exacerbations and minimising emergency department visits or hospitalisations, preventing progressive loss of lung function, and minimising adverse effects of medications.[33]

# Secondary prevention

Viral infections are a significant trigger for acute asthma exacerbations. While influenza vaccination is recommended in many countries for children with asthma, studies to date have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of vaccination on asthma exacerbation rate or lung function decline.[127] However, the available data suggest it is well tolerated and does not precipitate exacerbation.[127] [128] There is also insufficient evidence to support a beneficial role for pneumococcal vaccination in children with asthma.[129] Interventions to decrease environmental tobacco smoke exposure have been shown to be beneficial for children at high risk of asthma exacerbations.[130]

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

# Diagnosis

Case history
Case history #1
A 5-year-old girl presents to pe emergency department wip a 2-day history of coryza and cough wip intermittent low-grade fever. She developed an audible wheeze and respiratory distress pat was initially responsive to salbutamol via a pressurised metered-dose inhaler and small-volume spacer. However, symptoms have recurred wipin 2 hours of salbutamol administration. The patient has had a number of episodes of wheeze and dyspnoea over a 2-year period; pese were more common during pe winter monps. She required prednisolone on 2 occasions to treat severe wheeze. On examination she is in visible respiratory distress wip a respiratory rate of 40 breaps/minute and has accompanying accessory muscle use. Her oxygen saturations are 92% in room air, and on auscultation of her chest pere is widespread polyphonic wheeze and equal air entry. She has an audible moist cough.
Case history #2
A 12-year-old girl presents to pe emergency department wip a 12-hour history of a troublesome cough followed by wheezing and increasing breaplessness unresponsive to inhaled salbutamol. She has had troublesome aspma since pe age of 18 monps. Over pe past few monps, her aspma has been managed wip fluticasone/salmeterol via a pressurised metered-dose inhaler and large-volume spacer, and an salbutamol inhaler, which is used as needed. She has been poorly compliant wip her preventive medication, adhering only when symptomatic. On examination she is extremely distressed. She appears slightly cyanosed on air, and pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84%. She has marked use of accessory muscles and is unable to speak in sentences but can say single words. She has marked pulsus paradoxus on palpation. On auscultation of pe chest, pere is widespread expiratory wheeze but equal air entry.

# Step-by-step diagnostic approach

A rapid triage assessment consisting of respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature is made at the time of presentation to guide treatment. Other key features of the examination are auscultation of the chest and, if possible, monitoring of peak flow. Absence of wheeze (silent chest) and pulsus paradoxus are features of the most severe exacerbations. In younger children the diagnosis of an acute exacerbation is clinical and based on the history and clinical findings. The exacerbation is classified into mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening based on the physical examination findings and PEFR/FEV1, although diagnosis of an acute exacerbation should not be dependent on tests.

# History and assessment of risk factors

Key features include the following.

- A sudden or gradual increase in wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and respiratory distress with hyper-inflation of the lungs due to air trapping. It is important to assess the onset and duration of symptoms and the response of symptoms to treatment. Symptom perception may be particularly poor during exacerbations, both by children and by parents. Wheeze is a poor predictor of severity due to lack of wheeze in severe airflow obstruction (silent chest). Cough is rarely the sole

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Diagnosis

Manifestation. Patients may report exercise limitation. Sleep disturbance, if present, is an indicator of poor baseline control.

- Exposure to triggers such as viral infection, inhaled allergens, environmental irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke), emotions (e.g., anger, anxiety), the act of laughter, or exercise.
- A previous history of asthma, as most exacerbations occur in children already known to have asthma. Risk factors for severe exacerbations include a previous history of hospitalisation or intubation for asthma. Adherence with regular medications should be assessed. A patient not previously known to be asthmatic may have a history of other atopic diseases such as eczema, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies. The presence of any atopic disease in a first-degree relative also increases the risk of asthma.
- Any other history suggesting an alternative diagnosis.

Physical examination

The general examination should begin with a rapid triage assessment consisting of respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature. Tachypnoea, commonly accompanied by tachycardia, is a characteristic sign of an acute exacerbation. Bradycardia is a pre-terminal sign. Measurement of oxygen saturation indicates the need for oxygen therapy. Pyrexia suggests infection. Cyanosis is a pre-terminal sign, indicative of severe hypoxaemia and respiratory failure. Exhaustion and decreased consciousness level are signs of impending respiratory arrest.

|Age|Respiratory rate (breaths per minute)|Heart rate (beats per minute)|
|---|---|---|
|0-2 months|&lt;60|&lt;160|
|2-12 months|&lt;50|&lt;120|
|1-5 years|&lt;40|&lt;120|
|6-8 years|80|&lt;110|
|9-11 years|110|&nbsp;|

Examination of the respiratory system should begin with an objective assessment of respiratory distress. The ability to speak is directly related to the degree of breathlessness but needs to be evaluated in relation to the developmental age of the child. In infants, the ability to feed reflects the degree of respiratory distress. Intercostal, sub-costal, or sternal retraction may accompany respiratory distress and reflects the large negative pressures that are being generated in an attempt to increase airflow. Other associated features are nasal flaring and tracheal tug. Accessory muscles such as the sternocleidomastoid, parasternal, and scalene muscles, among others, are recruited with more severe respiratory distress. In young infants, accessory muscle recruitment may manifest as head bobbing.

Auscultation of the lung fields typically reveals polyphonic, high-pitched, widespread wheeze. The intensity of wheeze is a poor predictor of severity due to the lack of wheeze in severe airflow obstruction (silent chest). Wheeze may become biphasic with increasing airway obstruction. Pulsus paradoxus is defined as a fall of greater than 10 mmHg in systolic BP with inspiration and may also be present.

# DIAGNOSIS

Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Diagnosis

However, it is a poor indicator of exacerbation severity and should not be routinely used to assess severity.[29] It is also a challenging sign to elicit in clinical practice.

Therapeutic trial with a short-acting beta-2 agonist

Reversible bronchoconstriction is a hallmark feature of asthma, and the initial response to bronchodilator therapy can be a useful guide to the accuracy of asthma as the diagnosis. A lack of response to beta-2 agonists can indicate a severe asthma exacerbation, but should also prompt consideration of other diagnoses, especially if seen in the context of stable, well-controlled asthma or as a first presentation of asthma-like symptoms.

Initial investigations depending on severity

- Reproducible spirometry and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)

- These are difficult to assess in young children, even when well, and are therefore rarely used during the initial assessment or for monitoring progress of acute asthma in children.
- If the measurement is attempted, it should be performed with the patient standing and the best value of 3 attempts taken. The degree of reduction in PEFR, expressed as a percentage of the predicted value, reflects the severity of the exacerbation. In the US, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidance classifies severity as follows, based on initial PEFR or FEV1: mild: ≥70%; moderate: 40% to 69%; severe: 25% to 39%; life-threatening: <25%.[33] International guidance uses different PEFR thresholds to define severity.[29] [35]

- Blood gases

- Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are rarely measured in children and are reserved for life-threatening exacerbations. Free-flowing venous blood gases, taken at the time of intravenous cannulation, provide an approximation of PaCO2.[36]
- The typical finding is of low PaCO2 due to pronounced tachypnoea. However, impending exhaustion causes CO2 retention; this is a sign of impending respiratory failure.

Other investigations

- CXR is not indicated routinely. Its main use, to exclude other diagnoses, is indicated in patients presenting with their first episode of asthma, particularly if clinical features are atypical, and in patients with severe exacerbations who have had an atypical response to initial treatment. It is also indicated to assess focal signs on examination suggestive of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
- The CXR is often normal, but findings include hyper-inflation (in uncomplicated asthma), pneumothorax, atelectasis, pneumonia, or lobar collapse with consolidation.

Risk factors

- Strong viral infection

- Viral infections have been reported to cause 80% to 85% of exacerbations.[17] Rhinovirus is the most common viral trigger.[16] A significant correlation of hospital admissions with seasonal patterns for upper respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated.[13]

• Wide range of potential allergic triggers, including house dust mite, pets (cats and dogs), pollen (tree, weed, and grass), food allergens, fungi (Alternaria), and cockroaches. More pan 80% of children are sensitised to environmental allergens.[20] Sensitisation wip Alternaria has been associated wip more severe aspma exacerbations.[21]
exercise
• Airway obstruction is stimulated by evaporative water loss from pe airway surface during exercise.[26]
non-adherence wip regular aspma medication
• Non-adherence wip preventive medication leads to a deterioration of aspma symptom control and an increased risk of exacerbations.
history of oper atopic disease
• Oper atopic diseases such as eczema, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies are risk factors for pe development of aspma.
family history of atopic disease
• Presence of any atopic disease in a first-degree relative increases pe risk of aspma.
previous history of severe aspma exacerbation
• Previous severe exacerbations requiring ICU admission or intubation are significant risk factors for furper acute severe exacerbations.[29]
low socio-economic status
• Poverty is associated wip increased risk of exacerbation and hospital attendance. May in part be related to lack of access to healp care and under-use of medication.[30]
environmental irritants
• While a detrimental effect on respiratory symptoms and lung function has been demonstrated,[22] environmental irritants are not major predictors of paediatric aspma exacerbations.[23] However, environmental irritants can worsen exacerbations triggered by inhaled antigens or viruses.

# DIAGNOSIS

Acute asthma exacerbation in children
Diagnosis

# obesity

- While obesity has been associated with increased asthma severity, the childhood data are not supportive of this conclusion, and the mechanism of this suggested association is not fully understood.[28]

# non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use

- NSAID-sensitive asthma is much less common in children than in adults, with an incidence of 2% noted in one paediatric study.[31]

# History & examination factors

- Key diagnostic factors

- presence of risk factors (common)
- - Strong risk factors include viral infection, exposure to inhaled allergens, exercise, non-adherence to preventive medication, history of atopic disease in the patient or a first-degree relative, history of severe asthma exacerbations, low socioeconomic status, and history of environmental irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke).

wheezing (common)
- - Polyphonic, high-pitched, widespread wheeze is a characteristic sign. Intensity of wheeze is a poor predictor of severity due to the lack of wheeze in severe airflow obstruction (silent chest). Wheeze may become biphasic with increasing airway obstruction.

shortness of breath (common)
- - Characteristic symptom.

tachypnoea (common)
- - Characteristic sign.

chest tightness (common)

- Other diagnostic factors

- cough (common)
- - While cough may be a component, it is rarely the sole manifestation. Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations.

exercise limitation (common)
- - Parents or the patient complain of an inability to exercise due to shortness of breath.

tachycardia (common)
- - Commonly accompanies tachypnoea.

inability to speak or feed (common)

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Diagnosis
• Directly related to degree of breaplessness. Needs to be evaluated in relation to pe developmental age of pe child. In infants, ability to feed reflects pe degree of respiratory distress.
• Intercostal, sub-costal, or sternal retraction (common)
• May accompany respiratory distress and reflects pe large negative pressures pat are being generated in an attempt to increase airflow. Oper associated features are nasal flaring and tracheal tug.
• Accessory muscle use (common)
• Sternocleidomastoid, parasternal, and scalene muscles, among opers, are recruited wip more severe respiratory distress. In young infants, accessory muscle recruitment may manifest as head bobbing.
• Pulsus paradoxus (uncommon)
• Defined as a fall of >10 mmHg in systolic BP wip inspiration. A poor indicator of exacerbation severity and should not be routinely used.
• Sleep disturbance (uncommon)
• May be present. Used as an indicator of baseline aspma symptom control.
• Bradycardia (uncommon)
• Pre-terminal sign in acute aspma.
• Cyanosis (uncommon)
• Pre-terminal sign indicating severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
• Exhaustion (uncommon)
• Indicates impending respiratory arrest.
• Decreased consciousness level (uncommon)
• Indicates impending respiratory arrest.

# DIAGNOSIS

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

# Diagnosis

|Diagnostic tests|
|---|
|1st test to order|
|Test|Result|
|therapeutic trial with a short-acting beta-2 agonist|variable clinical improvement depending on severity|
|- Reversible bronchoconstriction is a hallmark feature of asthma.
- Lack of response indicates either a severe exacerbation or an alternative diagnosis.
|
|peak expiratory flow rate or FEV1|decreased|
|- Reproducible spirometry and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) are difficult to assess in young children, even when well, and therefore rarely used. However, this may be the only test available in primary care.
- Studies have shown that during acute exacerbations reproducible measurements are also difficult in older children.
- Should be measured with the patient standing and the best value of 3 attempts taken.
- Reduction in PEFR, expressed as percentage of predicted value or personal best, reflects severity of the exacerbation. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidance classifies severity as follows, based on initial PEFR or FEV1: mild: ≥70%; moderate: 40% to 69%; severe: 25% to 39%; life-threatening: <25%. International guidance uses different PEFR thresholds to define severity.
|

# Other tests to consider

|Test|Result|
|---|---|
|arterial/venous blood gases|low PaCO2 (<35 mmHg); rise with impending exhaustion|
|- Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are reserved for life-threatening exacerbations to assess PaCO2 retention/respiratory acidosis, a sign of impending respiratory failure.
- Free-flowing venous blood gases, taken at the time of intravenous cannulation, provide an approximation of arterial PaCO2.
- PaCO2 levels drop due to pronounced tachypnoea. PaCO2 rises again as exhaustion sets in, into the normal range (35 to 45 mmHg); this is a sign of impending respiratory failure.
| |
|CXR|normal or variably abnormal|
|- Not indicated routinely in acute exacerbations of asthma.
- May be used to exclude other diagnoses in patients presenting with their first episode of asthma, particularly if clinical features are atypical, and in patients with severe exacerbations who have had an atypical response to initial treatment.
- Also used to assess focal signs on examination suggestive of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
- Findings include hyper-inflation, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pneumonia, or lobar collapse with consolidation.

Diagnosis

# Differential diagnosis

|Condition|Differentiating signs / symptoms|Differentiating tests|
|---|---|---|
|Inhaled foreign body|Sudden onset of symptoms, such as cough, wheeze, or choking.|Inspiratory and expiratory CXRs may reveal asymmetry of chest expansion, due to the ball-valve mechanism of the foreign body. Bronchoscopy is necessary for diagnosis and retrieval of the foreign body.|
|Viral-induced infantile wheezing|Onset in infancy. No associated atopy. Associated with maternal smoking. Diagnosis usually made retrospectively once the child has left the infantile age range.|Skin prick testing is negative; may provide supportive evidence but is not definitive.|
|Aspiration|History of vomiting and/or history of choking or coughing during swallowing (in particular, when neurodevelopmental abnormality is present). Focal signs of pneumonitis or pneumonia may be present on examination.|Focal signs of pneumonitis or pneumonia on CXR. Modified barium swallow may confirm diagnosis.|
|Anaphylaxis|Acute anaphylaxis may present with associated respiratory distress and wheeze. Urticaria and signs of upper airway obstruction may be present. History of environmental exposure to a possible or known anaphylactic stimulus.|Clinical diagnosis.|
|Cardiac failure|Other features of cardiac failure are present (tachycardia, gallop rhythm, or hepatomegaly). Associated with congenital or acquired heart disease.|Cardiomegaly on CXR. Congenital heart disease and impaired cardiac function are demonstrated on an echocardiogram.|
|Pneumonia|Focal signs may be present on examination and include crepitations, decreased air entry, bronchial breathing, and dull percussion note.|Consolidation on CXR.

# DIAGNOSIS

|Condition|Differentiating signs / symptoms|Differentiating tests|
|---|---|---|
|Pneumothorax|- Sudden onset of chest pain or dyspnoea.
- Larger pneumothoraces may have signs of decreased air entry and hyper-resonant percussion note on examination.
- No wheeze on auscultation.
- May complicate an asthma exacerbation.
|Pneumothorax is seen on CXR.|
|Pertussis|- Infection with Bordetella pertussis causes prolonged coughing (also called the '100-day cough').
- Spasmodic coughing may lead to post-tussive emesis.
- Characteristic whoop may not be evident in younger children.
|- Pertussis PCR test for pertussis antigen on nasal swab sample.
- Absolute lymphocytosis of WBC differential may be present.
|
|Cystic fibrosis (CF)|- Airway inflammation associated with CF may precipitate wheeze, cough, and respiratory distress.
- CF due to milder mutations may present with asthma that is difficult to control or treatment-resistant.
- Asthma may co-exist with CF.
- Failure to thrive may be present.
|Sweat test: sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L on repeat samples is diagnostic (levels of 40 to 60 mmol/L should be considered indeterminate and suspicious).|
|Tracheo- or bronchomalacia|- Characterised by expiratory stridor.
- Recurrent acute episodes of stridor and dyspnoea usually present in the neonatal period and diminish during the first 2 years of life.
|Bronchoscopy reveals collapse of the trachea or bronchus during expiration.|
|Acute bronchitis|- Characterised by moist cough in combination with wheeze, and may be caused by bacterial or viral infection.
- Bacterial cause is suggested by purulent sputum and response to antibiotics.
|In bacterial bronchitis, sputum culture commonly isolates Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae.|
|Paradoxical vocal cord motion|Paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords during inspiration produces high characteristic symptoms.|Exercise testing may reproduce the characteristic symptoms.|

# Diagnostic criteria

# Variations between criteria

Each guideline listed below has its own set of criteria to define the severity of an exacerbation of asthma. There are areas of discordance between the criteria used at present (e.g. oxygen saturation and PEFR thresholds).

From the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) ID

Please note: the NHLBI criteria cover all ages (including adults). However, the normal ranges for respiratory rate and heart rate when awake at rest are specified for different age groups (see table below).

# Mild:

- Dyspnoea only with activity; patient talks in sentences
- Increased respiratory rate; no increase in heart rate
- Usually no accessory muscle use or suprasternal retractions
- Moderate wheeze (often only end expiratory)
- Absent pulsus paradoxus (&lt;10 mmHg)
- Oxygen saturations (arterial oxygen saturation [SaO2]) on air &gt;95%
- Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) (or FEV1) 70% or more of predicted or percentage of personal best.

# Moderate:

- Dyspnoea interferes with or limits usual activity; patient talks in phrases

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

# Treatment Step-by-step treatment approach

Early recognition of an acute asthma exacerbation is crucial for effective management. Initial therapy includes correction of hypoxaemia and reversal or prevention of airflow obstruction. A pertinent clinical history should be obtained and physical examination performed to establish the diagnosis and to assess the severity of the exacerbation. A good response to treatment is characterised by resolution of wheeze and tachypnoea, whereas, in an incomplete response, the wheeze and tachypnoea will persist.

Increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids at the start of an exacerbation is not recommended, as it is ineffective and inferior to systemic corticosteroid therapy. In addition, there is no current evidence to support increasing the maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroid or the use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroid during exacerbations. The concept of using low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, taken together with a short-acting beta-2 agonist, as required with exacerbations, has been suggested as step-down therapy for children with well-controlled asthma on daily inhaled corticosteroids. This seems to provide an additional option to short-acting beta-2 agonist use alone, but requires further study before it can be adopted in recommendations. Although this is an attractive option, having no symptoms does not equate to having no disease.

Oral corticosteroids remain an important aspect of management, although their optimal dose and duration are still unclear. As a result, recommendations across international guidelines differ. One RCT in children showed no additional benefit of a 5-day versus a 3-day course of oral corticosteroids in reducing 2-week morbidity in children with mild asthma exacerbations not requiring hospitalisation.

Chest physiotherapy is avoided during an exacerbation due to the danger of precipitating clinical deterioration. However, patients with hyper-secretory asthma may benefit from physiotherapy in the recovery phase.

In infants and pre-school children, the diagnosis of asthma can be difficult to make due to other overlapping wheeze phenotypes, such as recurrent viral-induced wheeze. The role of oral and inhaled corticosteroids in this latter group has been investigated in a number of studies. However, this treatment approach focuses on treating children with established asthma.

# Mild exacerbation

The US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidance defines a mild exacerbation as follows: patients are alert, have exertional dyspnoea only, and can talk in sentences, with an increase in respiratory rate but no accessory muscle use. Wheeze is moderate and often only end expiratory. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) on air is greater than 95%, and the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR, or FEV1) is 70% or more of predicted value or percentage of personal best. International guidelines, such as those from the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the British Thoracic Society and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (BTS/SIGN), use different criteria to define severity of exacerbations.

Mild exacerbations do not usually require hospital admission. An inhaled, short-acting beta-2 agonist is usually sufficient to reverse airway obstruction; a spacer is just as effective as a nebuliser. The patient should be re-assessed 15 to 20 minutes after treatment and a further dose given if needed; the response to therapy should be immediate and sustained for 3 to 4 hours.

# TREATMENTAcute asthma exacerbation in children

Oral corticosteroids may be required to prevent deterioration. Antibiotic perapy is generally not required
and is reserved for cases in which bacterial infection is pe trigger.
Moderate exacerbation
NHLBI guidance defines a moderate exacerbation as follows: patients are alert and dyspnoea interferes
wip or limits usual activity. The patient can talk in phrases raper pan sentences, and has an increased
respiratory rate and heart rate wip accessory muscle use and suprasternal retractions. Wheeze is usually
loud. SaO2 on air is 91% to 95%, and pe PEFR (or FEV1) is 40% to 69% predicted or percentage of
personal best.[33] International guidelines, such as pose from GINA and BTS/SIGN, use different criteria
to define severity of exacerbations.[29] [35]
Admission to hospital is usually necessary. Oxygen may be required to maintain SaO2. An inhaled, short-
acting beta-2 agonist should be administered immediately and pe response assessed every 15 to 20
minutes; a spacer
is just as effective as a nebuliser for administering perapy.[51] Up to 3 doses may be required in pe first
hour if pe response is inadequate.
Oral corticosteroids target pe airway oedema and secretions pat accompany an acute exacerbation and
have been shown to reduce admission rates.
Inhaled anticholinergics can be added if pere is no response to initial treatment.[33] [29] [35]
Antibiotic perapy is generally not required and is reserved for cases in which bacterial infection is pe
trigger.
Severe or life-preatening exacerbation
NHLBI guidance defines severe or life-preatening exacerbations as follows: patients appear agitated
or drowsy and have dyspnoea at rest; infants stop feeding due to pe increased work of breaping and
altered mental state. Cyanosis may also be present. Patients eiper talk in words or are unable to talk.
The respiratory rate is increased, and heart rate may be increased or decreased (a pre-terminal sign).
Marked accessory muscle use is present wip suprasternal retractions and possible poraco-abdominal
movement. Wheeze is usually loud but may be absent ('silent chest'). SaO2 on air is less pan 90%, and
pe PEFR (or FEV1) is 25% to 39% (severe) or less pan 25% (life-preatening) predicted or percentage of
personal best.[33] International guidelines, such as pose from GINA and BTS/SIGN, use different criteria
to define severity of exacerbations.[29] [35]
All patients should be admitted to hospital. Oxygen perapy, nebulised short-acting beta-2 agonists, and
systemic corticosteroid perapy should be started immediately. Continuous nebulisation of short-acting
beta-2 agonists is superior to intermittent administration.
Some international guidelines separate management of severe and life-preatening exacerbations. For
example, pe BTS/SIGN guidelines recommend delivery of short-acting beta-2 agonists via spacer or
nebuliser for severe exacerbations, but only via nebuliser for life-preatening exacerbations.[29] There
is a lack of evidence for equivalent efficacy to nebulised delivery in life-preatening episodes, and, for
simplicity, pis monograph suggests nebulised delivery for bop severe and life-preatening exacerbations.

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Treatment
Frequent administration of beta-2 agonist can cause transient decreases in potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Potassium levels should be monitored in all children receiving regular beta-2 agonist perapy and replaced as required. In children unable to tolerate oral corticosteroid perapy, or where adherence is a significant concern, an alternative is intramuscular (IM) dexamepasone, which has been shown to be comparable to a 5-day course of oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) in 2 paediatric RCTs (total n = 292).[28] [30]
In severe aspma, inhaled anticholinergics should be given in conjunction wip short-acting beta-2 agonists,[33] [35] and if pe response remains inadequate, pen intravenous magnesium sulfate or oper intravenous bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists or a mepylxanpine) should be considered. One Cochrane review failed to find any consistent evidence favouring eiper intravenous beta-2 agonists or intravenous aminophylline for patients wip acute aspma.[59]
There is some evidence to suggest pat inhaled magnesium sulfate may be useful in severe aspma exacerbations, in children wip more severe attacks (SaO2 on air <92%) at presentation, and in pose wip preceding symptoms lasting less pan 6 hours.[60] [61] This modest benefit has not been found consistently across studies.[62] [61] Furper studies are required before any firm recommendations can be made, alpough its use has started to appear in international guidelines.[29] [35]
While most severe aspma is not related to anaphylaxis and does not require intramuscular epinephrine (adrenaline), intramuscular epinephrine (adrenaline) should be considered if signs of anaphylaxis are present.[33] [35]
Antibiotic perapy is generally not required and is reserved for cases in which bacterial infection is pe trigger.
The anaespetic or paediatric intensive care team needs to be involved. If pere are signs of impending respiratory failure (confusion or marked agitation, loss of respiratory effort, pulsus paradoxus, cyanosis, hypoxaemia, or respiratory acidosis) despite intravenous bronchodilators and magnesium sulfate, patients may require intubation and mechanical ventilation wip 100% oxygen.

# Ventilation

The role of non-invasive ventilation in acute asthma management in children has been reviewed.[63] The application of positive pressure in the setting of severe acute bronchospasm may be beneficial in preventing airway collapse and reducing the mechanical load on already tired muscles of respiration.[64] This may be achieved using non-invasive ventilation (NIV; either continuous positive airways pressure, CPAP, or bi-level non-invasive ventilation), applied using either a nasal or full-face mask interface. Sedation is occasionally necessary for patient tolerance, but should be used with caution. Appropriate use of NIV may avoid the subsequent need for invasive ventilation. If intubation is required, a ventilation strategy ensuring adequate expiratory time, given the underlying pathophysiology, should be used to aid gas exchange. Muscle relaxation may be necessary.

# Treatment prior to discharge

Once the acute exacerbation has resolved, maintenance treatment is revisited and preventive treatment is optimised so that future exacerbations are prevented. Inhaler technique is assessed, and the patient is advised regarding avoidance of trigger factors and early recognition of an exacerbation.

# TREATMENT: Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Acute mild exacerbation
1st inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist
Primary options
- Salbutamol inhaled: (100 micrograms/dose metered-dose inhaler) 100 micrograms (1 puff) every 15-30 seconds, up to a maximum of 10 puffs, pen every 20-30 minutes when required
- US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidance defines a mild exacerbation as follows: patients are alert, have exertional dyspnoea only, and can talk in sentences. Increased respiratory rate but no accessory muscle use. Wheeze is moderate and often only end expiratory. Arterial oxygen saturation on air is >95%. Peak expiratory flow rate (or FEV1) ≥70% predicted or percentage of personal best.
- Short-acting beta-2 agonists should be administered via a spacer, as pis has been shown to be as effective as nebulisers in mild exacerbations. A face mask should be used in children <4 years of age.
- Mild exacerbations do not usually require hospital admission.

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Treatment
Acute exacerbation generally recommended, alpough international guidelines support longer courses (e.g. 3-5 days, in British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [BTS/SIGN] guidance, and 5-7 days, in Global Initiative for Aspma [GINA] guidance). In pe aupors' experience, pe child should be reviewed on day 3 and, if necessary, a longer course given. One paediatric RCT did not support pe routine use of a 5-day course, in comparison to a 3-day course.
Systemic adverse effects such as adrenal suppression may occur.
Adjunct antibiotic perapy
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in selected patient group
Primary options
azipromycin: 10 mg/kg orally once daily on pe first day, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for 4 days
claripromycin: 15 mg/kg/day orally given in divided doses every 12 hours, maximum 1000 mg/day
erypromycin base: 30-50 mg/kg/day orally given in divided doses every 6 hours
Antibiotics are reserved for exacerbations triggered by a bacterial infection of pe upper respiratory tract.
Choice of antibiotic depends on causative organism. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is pe most common.

# TREATMENT: Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Acute dyspnoea interferes wip or limits usual activity.
The patient can talk in phrases raper pan sentences. Increased respiratory rate and heart rate wip accessory muscle use and suprasternal retractions. Wheeze is usually loud. Arterial oxygen saturation on air is 91% to 95%. Peak expiratory flow rate (or FEV1) is 40% to 69% predicted or percentage of personal best.

- Treatment should be given immediately. Dose and frequency need to be adjusted according to clinical response. Response should be assessed every 15 to 20 minutes.
- Inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist should be administered via a spacer.
- A face mask should be used in children <4 years of age.
- Admission to hospital is usually necessary, particularly if there is a poor response to initial treatment.

Plus oral corticosteroid

Treatment recommended for ALL patients in selected patient group

Primary options:

- prednisolone: 1 mg/kg/day orally once daily, maximum 40 mg/day

Oral corticosteroids should be started early.

Only one RCT to date has examined differing doses of prednisolone in children with acute asthma, and no difference was found between the different doses used.

Optimal duration of therapy is also unclear. Single doses of oral corticosteroids on admission to hospital have failed to show a consistent benefit, although 3- and 5-day courses show a consistent benefit. A 3-day course is generally recommended, although international guidelines support longer courses (e.g. 3-5 days, in BTS/SIGN guidance, and 5-7 days, in GINA guidance). In the authors' experience, the child should be reviewed on day 3 and if necessary a longer course given. One paediatric RCT did not support the routine use of a 5-day course, in comparison to a 3-day course.

(SABA) and a short-acting anticholinergic in the emergency department were less likely to be admitted to hospital than those who only had a SABA.[68]

- International guidelines state that inhaled anticholinergics can be added if there is no response to initial treatment in patients with moderate to severe exacerbations.[29] [35]
- If given, anticholinergic therapy should be administered every 20 minutes for the first hour and then re-assessed.[33] [35]
- Anticholinergics agents produce a weaker bronchodilation response with a slower onset of action (30-90 minutes versus 5-15 minutes) than beta-2 agonists.[69] They have a beneficial effect when added to beta-2 agonist therapy by relieving cholinergic bronchomotor tone and secretions.
- Use in children <2 years of age, excluding children with bronchiolitis and chronic lung disease of prematurity, remains unclear and is not recommended routinely.[70]
- Potential adverse effects include drying of the mouth and respiratory secretions. Cardiac stimulation occurs but is less marked than that produced by beta-2 agonists.

severe/life-threatening exacerbation

1st
oxygen + hospital admission

- NHLBI guidance defines severe or life-threatening exacerbations as follows: patients appear agitated or drowsy and have dyspnoea at rest; infants stop feeding due to the increased work of breathing and altered mental state; cyanosis may be present; they talk in words or are unable to talk. Respiratory rate is increased, and heart rate may be increased or decreased. Marked accessory muscle use is present with suprasternal retractions. Wheeze is usually loud but may be absent (silent chest). Arterial oxygen saturation on air is <90% and peak expiratory flow rate (or FEV1) is 25% to 39% (severe) or <25% (life-threatening) predicted or percentage of personal best.[33]
- All patients should be admitted to hospital.
- Oxygen therapy should be administered immediately. Oxygen saturations should be maintained ≥90%.[33] Some international guidelines target a higher oxygen saturation level

Secondary options
salbutamol inhaled: 2.5 to 5 mg nebulised as a single dose, pen every 20-30 minutes when required
Beta-2 agonists should be administered by continuous nebulisation. There is a lack of evidence to support pe use of spacers in pis setting.
A face mask should be used in children <4 years of age.[35]
The nebuliser should be driven by oxygen raper pan room air, as oxygen perapy must be maintained;[29] [35]beta-2 agonists may precipitate furper oxygen de-saturation via pulmonary vasodilation in areas of poorly ventilated lung.
Frequent administration of beta-2 agonists can cause transient decreases in potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Potassium levels should be monitored in all children and replaced as required.[29]
Caution is required in children wip pre-existing cardiac disease.

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Treatment
Acute exacerbation treatment is generally recommended. In pe aupors' experience, pe child should be reviewed on day 3, and if necessary duration may be increased up to 10 days in more severe exacerbations.

# Intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone

In children unable to tolerate oral corticosteroid perapy, or where adherence is a significant concern, an alternative is intramuscular (IM) dexamepasone, which has been shown to be comparable to a 5-day course of oral corticosteroids in two paediatric RCTs (total n = 292).
Systemic adverse effects (such as adrenal suppression) may be more common wip IM long-acting corticosteroids (e.g., dexamepasone).

# Adjunct antibiotic therapy

Treatment recommended for SOME patients in selected patient group

# Primary options

azipromycin: 10 mg/kg orally once daily on pe first day, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for 4 days
claripromycin: 15 mg/kg/day orally given in divided doses every 12 hours, maximum 1000 mg/day
erypromycin base: 30-50 mg/kg/day orally given in divided doses every 6 hours

Antibiotics are reserved for exacerbations triggered by a bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract.

|While most severe asthma is not related to anaphylaxis and does not require intramuscular adrenaline (epinephrine), it should be considered if signs of anaphylaxis are present.[33] [35]| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|no response to initial treatment or impending respiratory failure|plus intravenous bronchodilator| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

# Primary options

- magnesium sulfate: 40-50 mg/kg intravenously as a single dose, maximum 2000 mg/dose; 150 mg nebulised every 20 minutes in the first hour. When nebulised, can be added to nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium.

# Secondary options

- salbutamol: 15 micrograms/kg intravenous bolus over 10 minutes; 1-2 micrograms/kg/minute intravenous infusion adjusted according to response and heart rate, maximum 5 micrograms/kg/minute. Doses above 1-2 micrograms/kg/minute should be given in a paediatric ICU with appropriate monitoring.
- terbutaline: 0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously every 20 minutes for 3 doses, then every 2-6 hours when required, maximum 0.25 mg/dose

# Tertiary options

- aminophylline: 5 mg/kg intravenous loading dose (omit in those already receiving an oral methylxanthine), followed by 1 mg/kg/hour continuous infusion

Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to be safe and beneficial, with improved lung function and symptom scores. It is now the recommended first-line intravenous bronchodilator in this setting across international guidelines.[29] [33] [35] Patients should be closely monitored for respiratory depression.

Inhaled magnesium sulfate is less effective, so intravenous administration is preferred.[74] There is some evidence to suggest that inhaled magnesium sulfate may be useful in severe asthma exacerbations, in children with more severe attacks (SaO2 on air <92%) at presentation, and in those with preceding.

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

Treatment
Acute symptoms lasting less pan 6 hours.[60] [61] This modest benefit has not been found consistently across studies.[62] [61] As a result, nebulised magnesium sulfate has started to appear in some international treatment guidelines, alpough international consensus about its role in management is yet to be reached.
An intravenous beta-2 agonist is recommended second-line in some, but not all, international guidelines (e.g., GINA does not recommend treatment wip an intravenous beta-2 agonist). Intravenous salbutamol is pe preferred option. Subcutaneous terbutaline may be recommended in locations where intravenous salbutamol is not available. Improved clinical outcomes wip intravenous beta-2 agonists have been reported in individual RCTs, but not confirmed on meta-analysis. Serum potassium levels should be checked regularly and supplemented as required.
Mepylxanpines (aminophylline or peophylline) are considered pird-line in many guidelines, but peir exact role in aspma management requires furper clarification. Continuous ECG monitoring is required during administration. In pose receiving continuous perapy, serum drug levels should be checked regularly and dose adjusted accordingly.
Adjunct ventilation plus transfer to ICU Treatment recommended for SOME patients in selected patient group
Clinical symptoms of exhaustion, cyanosis, or drowsiness wip hypoxemia and hypercapnia are indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
A ventilation strategy ensuring adequate expiratory time should be used to aid gas exchange. Muscle relaxation may be necessary.
The pediatric intensive care team and/or anespetists wip pediatric training should be alerted early; intubation is preferred before pe onset of respiratory arrest.
Fluid replacement will be required in pese patients, as pey are frequently fluid depleted, and initiation of positive pressure ventilation may be accompanied by hypotension.
Non-invasive ventilation may be used as a rescue perapy to avoid intubation. Continuous positive airways pressure, CPAP, or bi-level non-invasive ventilation can be applied using eiper

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

# Treatment

Emerging

Heliox

Heliox is a helium/oxygen mixture that has a lower gas density and higher viscosity than room air or oxygen; its use therefore reduces flow resistance and enhances airway penetration. As a stand-alone therapy in children, a potential benefit in severe acute asthma has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis, which included 3 RCTs, although sample sizes were small. In a further recent small RCT, the use of heliox as a facilitator of aerosol delivery produced a significant improvement in clinical scores at 2 to 4 hours and discharge rates at 12 hours. Further studies are required to firmly establish a role in asthma management.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists

Leukotrienes are pro-inflammatory mediators that play important roles in both early and late asthmatic airway response to allergen challenge. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) inhibit a part of the asthmatic inflammatory response that is relatively unaffected by oral corticosteroids, and provide some degree of bronchodilation. A benefit is detectable after just 10 minutes with intravenous administration and after 2 hours if administered orally. Although evidence suggests that the use of IV leukotriene antagonists may be beneficial, with a trend towards significant reduction in the risk of hospital admission, more studies are needed before recommendations can be made. Although improvements in FEV1 have been described in adults, an RCT of intravenous montelukast added to standard therapy in children failed to show any benefit in FEV1 or symptom scores after 60 minutes. The intravenous route is not currently used in clinical practice. Studies with oral LTRA in the acute exacerbation setting have been less encouraging. Although both adult and paediatric studies have described improvements in FEV1 favouring LTRA, no beneficial effect on hospital admission rates have been described. In pre-school children, co-administration of LTRAs with the first dose of a short-acting beta-2 agonist improved respiratory rate and symptom scores up to 4 hours and decreased oral corticosteroid use at 1 hour compared with placebo (20.8% versus 38.5%). Parent-initiated oral LTRA administration in intermittent asthma produced a modest reduction in healthcare utilisation, symptoms, and time off school/work when given for 7 days or from the onset of an exacerbation to 48 hours post-resolution. A further study showed benefit in symptom severity scores alone. However, one study showed that addition of oral montelukast for treatment of acute asthma (in addition to standard therapy of inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids) did not provide any clinical benefit. Although some of these results are promising, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend its routine use in the acute asthma setting. Concerns about increased incidence of suicide led to an FDA warning in 2009, but there are no strong data to support this association at present.

Single maintenance and reliever therapy

The introduction of formoterol as a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) with a speed of onset similar to short-acting beta-2 agonists, and its availability in a single inhaler with budesonide, has challenged the traditional approach of separate preventer and reliever inhalers. Although initial adult and paediatric data suggest benefits when using this combination, there are insufficient paediatric data currently available. Concerns about the ability of this approach to achieve good asthma control in adults have been raised, with evidence of increased levels of airway inflammation in adults treated with this approach. Furthermore, safety concerns about the regular use of LABAs in children remain, although more recent data suggest LABA (in combination) is likely to be safe in children. Therefore, further research is needed before this combination inhaler can be recommended in paediatric asthma management. The efficacy of formoterol in comparison with other short-acting beta-2 agonists appears to be comparable in both adults and children. However, further studies are required before formoterol can be recommended in the acute setting, and it is not part of current national or international guidelines for acute asthma management.

# FOLLOW UP

# Acute asthma exacerbation in children

# Recommendations

# Monitoring

Patients with severe asthma exacerbations may have labile airway obstruction for several days after the onset of the acute exacerbation. Medication on discharge should reflect this, including considering longer courses of oral corticosteroids (OCS). The role of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on discharge, either as a substitute for or in addition to OCS, is unclear. There is some evidence that high-dose ICS may be equivalent to OCS in mild asthmatics, but wide confidence intervals exist and more evidence is needed in this area.[111] [112] Worsening of symptoms should prompt clinical re-assessment and re-hospitalisation if required. Follow-up with a primary physician within 3 to 5 days after discharge from the emergency department or the hospital is required to assess the adequacy of the weaning asthma controller regimen. Referral to asthma follow-up care within 1 to 4 weeks of discharge should also be organised prior to discharge. Symptom monitoring is the most appropriate method of monitoring. Peak flow monitoring may play a role in children who are compliant with the technique and have poor patient or parent symptom perception. In addition, improving control of other related comorbidities, such as allergic rhinitis, may be beneficial to asthma control.[113]

# Patient instructions

Patients should receive written asthma management plans and education prior to discharge. Written asthma action plans have been shown to improve asthma outcomes.[114] [115] Symptom-based plans are superior to peak expiratory flow rate-based plans.[116] [117] Written management plans should document appropriate weaning of current medications given with the current exacerbation, and should provide appropriate management steps for future exacerbations, detailing the use of bronchodilators and when to seek medical attention. The need for regular inhaled corticosteroids or changes to existing preventive therapies should be considered. Cultural issues should also be taken into account.[118] One study showed that the use of parent mentors reduced the rate of asthma exacerbation in minority children with asthma.[119]

Education is an integral part of asthma management. While education of children and carers presenting to the emergency department has been shown to reduce further emergency department visits, hospitalisation, and unscheduled medical reviews, this degree of improvement has not been reported in all meta-analyses.[120] [121] [122] Education should include discussion of the underlying pathophysiology, explanation of the role of reliever and preventive medications, the importance of adherence, and assessment of the patient's or parent's technique of medication administration.[123] Spacers should be used in younger children who are unable to demonstrate adequate technique with inhalers alone.

Patients with a history of severe asthma exacerbations should be encouraged to seek medical review early in the course of future exacerbations. Involvement of other healthcare workers, such as pharmacists, may be beneficial.[124]

Parent-initiated oral corticosteroids may be appropriate for some patients, but further trials are required to establish firm recommendations. Studies to date have failed to demonstrate a general benefit of this approach for either school-aged children[52] [125] or pre-schoolers (with frequent viral-induced wheeze episodes).[126]

Medical review within 1 week of discharge should be arranged prior to discharge, and referral to a paediatric respiratory specialist should be considered. Some international guidelines recommend a shorter time frame for medical review (e.g., the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [BTS/SIGN] guideline specifies follow-up within 48 hours with a family doctor).[29]

|Complications|Timeframe|Likelihood|
|---|---|---|
|pneumonia|short term|low|
|May be the trigger for acute exacerbation or may be a complication of hyper-secretory asthma. In hyper-secretory asthma, the presence of lobar consolidation or collapse is not always diagnostic of pneumonia, as mucus secretion leads to airway obstruction and lobar collapse via mucus plugging. However, bacterial super-infection of compromised lung segments may subsequently lead to pneumonia. Antibiotics are indicated only in the presence of other signs of pneumonia such as increased WBC count or fever.| | |
|pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum|short term|low|
|Rare but important complications of acute asthma exacerbations. Pneumothorax may also be caused by barotrauma associated with mechanical ventilation. Pneumomediastinum rarely requires intervention. Pneumothorax is an important potential cause of death, and tension pneumothoraces should be managed with emergency needle thoracocentesis. Non-tension pneumothoraces should prompt intercostal chest catheter insertion.| | |
|respiratory failure|short term|low|
|Impending respiratory failure is indicated by decreased oxygen saturations, exhaustion, and rising carbon dioxide levels. Respiratory failure is an indication for mechanical ventilation; non-invasive ventilation is under investigation as an approach to avoiding intubation.| | |

# Prognosis

With prompt recognition of symptoms and access to care, the prognosis of an acute exacerbation is good. Most deaths from asthma are preventable. Childhood asthma mortality decreased in the US from 1.26 to 0.78 per 100,000 between 1995 and 2001. In the UK, asthma-related deaths in children between 1990 and 2000 remained at 2 per million per year. Risk factors for death related to asthma in children include poor adherence to treatment, adverse psychosocial factors (in children this may apply to the primary carer), and inadequate acute and/or long-term management of asthma. Exacerbations triggered by food allergy are more likely to be fatal. Patients whose asthma is poorly controlled are at an increased risk of future exacerbations and may develop airway remodelling over time, resulting in irreversible persistent airway obstruction. Furthermore, longitudinal studies have shown that episodes of severe asthma exacerbation are associated with a more rapid decline in overall lung function.
