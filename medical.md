In November 1995, my friend Ruth Holland, book reviews editor of the British Medical Journal, suggested that I write a book to demystify the important but often inaccessible subject of evidence-based medicine. She provided invaluable comments on the original draft of the manuscript, but was tragically killed in a train crash on 8th August 1996. This book is dedicated to her memory.

Foreword to the first edition by Professor Sir David Weatherall

Not surprisingly, the wide publicity given to what is now called evidence-based medicine has been greeted with mixed reactions by those who are involved in the provision of patient care. The bulk of the medical profession appears to be slightly hurt by the concept, suggesting as it does that until recently all medical practice was what Lewis Thomas has described as a frivolous and irresponsible kind of human experimentation, based on nothing but trial and error, and usually resulting in precisely that sequence. On the other hand, politicians and those who administrate our health services have greeted the notion with enormous glee. They had suspected all along that doctors were totally uncritical and now they had it on paper. Evidence-based medicine came as a gift from the gods because, at least as they perceived it, its implied efficiency must inevitably result in cost saving.

The concept of controlled clinical trials and evidence-based medicine is not new, however. It is recorded that Frederick II, Emperor of the Romans and King of Sicily and Jerusalem, who lived from 1192 to 1250 AD, and who was interested in the effects of exercise on digestion, took two knights and gave them identical meals. One was then sent out hunting and the other ordered to bed. At the end of several hours he killed both and examined the contents of their alimentary canals; digestion had proceeded further in the stomach of the sleeping knight. In the 17th century Jan Baptista van Helmont, a physician and philosopher, became sceptical of the practice of blood-letting. Hence he proposed what was almost certainly the first clinical trial involving large numbers, randomisation and statistical analysis. This involved taking 200–500 poor people, dividing them into two groups by casting lots, and protecting one from phlebotomy while allowing the other to be treated with as much blood-letting as his colleagues thought appropriate. The number of funerals in each group would be used to assess the efficacy of blood-letting. History does not record why this splendid experiment was never carried out.

If modern scientific medicine can be said to have had a beginning it was in Paris in the mid-19th century and where it had its roots in the work and teachings of Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis. Louis introduced statistical

analysis to the evaluation of medical treatment and, incidentally, showed that blood‐letting was a valueless form of treatment, although this did not change the habits of the physicians of the time, or for many years to come. Despite this pioneering work, few clinicians on either side of the Atlantic urged that trials of clinical outcome should be adopted, although the principles of numerically based experimental design were enunciated in the 1920s by the geneticist Ronald Fisher. The field only started to make a major impact on clinical practice after the Second World War following the seminal work of Sir Austin Bradford Hill and the British epidemiologists who followed him, notably Richard Doll and Archie Cochrane.

But although the idea of evidence‐based medicine is not new, modern disciples like David Sackett and his colleagues are doing a great service to clinical practice, not just by popularising the idea, but by bringing home to clinicians the notion that it is not a dry academic subject but more a way of thinking that should permeate every aspect of medical practice. While much of it is based on mega‐trials and meta‐analyses, it should also be used to influence almost everything that a doctor does. After all, the medical profession has been brain‐washed for years by examiners in medical schools and Royal Colleges to believe that there is only one way of examining a patient. Our bedside rituals could do with as much critical evaluation as our operations and drug regimes; the same goes for almost every aspect of doctoring.

As clinical practice becomes busier, and time for reading and reflection becomes even more precious, the ability effectively to peruse the medical literature and, in the future, to become familiar with a knowledge of best practice from modern communication systems, will be essential skills for doctors. In this lively book, Trisha Greenhalgh provides an excellent approach to how to make best use of medical literature and the benefits of evidence‐based medicine. It should have equal appeal for first year medical students and grey‐haired consultants, and deserves to be read widely.

With increasing years, the privilege of being invited to write a foreword to a book by one’s ex‐students becomes less of a rarity. Trisha Greenhalgh was the kind of medical student who never let her teachers get away with a loose thought and this inquiring attitude seems to have flowered over the years; this is a splendid and timely book and I wish it all the success it deserves. After all, the concept of evidence‐based medicine is nothing more than the state of mind that every clinical teacher hopes to develop in their students; Dr Greenhalgh’s skeptical but constructive approach to medical literature suggests that such a happy outcome is possible at least once in the lifetime of a professor of medicine.

# Preface to the sixth edition

When I wrote this book in 1996, evidence‐based medicine was a bit of an unknown quantity. A handful of academics (including me) were already enthusiastic and had begun running ‘training the trainers’ courses to disseminate what we saw as a highly logical and systematic approach to clinical practice. Others – certainly the majority of clinicians – were convinced that this was a passing fad that was of limited importance and would never catch on. I wrote How to Read a Paper for two reasons. First, students on my own courses were asking for a simple introduction to the principles presented in what was then known as ‘Dave Sackett’s big red book’ (Sackett DL, Haynes RB, Guyatt GH, Tugwell P. Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine. London, Little, Brown & Co., 1991) – an outstanding and inspirational volume that was already in its fourth reprint, but which some novices apparently found a hard read. Second, it was clear to me that many of the critics of evidence‐based medicine didn’t really understand what they were dismissing – and that until they did, serious debate on the clinical, pedagogical and even political place of evidence‐based medicine as a discipline could not begin.

I am of course delighted that How to Read a Paper has become a standard reader in many medical and nursing schools, and that so far it has been translated into 20 languages including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Polish, Japanese, Czech and Russian. I am also delighted that what was so recently a fringe subject in academia has been well and truly mainstreamed in clinical service. In the UK, for example, it is now a contractual requirement for all doctors, nurses and pharmacists to practise (and for managers to manage) according to best research evidence.

In the 23 years since the first edition of this book was published, evidence‐based medicine (and, more broadly, evidence‐based healthcare) has waxed and waned in popularity. Hundreds of textbooks and tens of thousands of journal articles now offer different angles on the ‘basics of EBM’ covered briefly in the chapters that follow. An increasing number of these sources point out genuine limitations of evidence‐based healthcare in certain contexts. Others look at evidence‐based medicine and healthcare as a social

movement – a ‘bandwagon’ that took off at a particular time (the 1990s) and
place (North America) and spread quickly with all sorts of knock‐on effects
for particular interest groups.

When preparing this sixth edition, I began with no fewer than 11 reviews
of the previous edition, mostly from students who are the book’s main target
audience. They wanted updated references, more worked examples, more
(and better) pictures and some questions to aid reflection at the end of each
chapter. I’ve added all these, along with a new chapter on population genetics
and big data. I did not change much else, because there is clearly still room
on the bookshelves for a no‐frills introductory text. Since the publication of
the fifth edition, I have written a new book on How to Implement Evidence‐
Based Healthcare, so I have removed the (now somewhat outdated) chapter
on implementation that was included in the fourth and fifth editions.

As ever, I would welcome any feedback that will help make the text more
accurate, readable and practical.

Preface to the first edition: do you need to read this book?

This book is intended for anyone, whether medically qualified or not, who wishes to find their way into the medical and healthcare literature, assess the scientific validity and practical relevance of the articles they find, and, where appropriate, put the results into practice. These skills constitute the basics of evidence-based medicine (if you’re thinking about what doctors do) or evidence-based healthcare (if you’re looking at the care of patients more widely).

I hope this book will improve your confidence in reading and interpreting papers relating to clinical decision-making. I hope, in addition, to convey a further message, which is this. Many of the descriptions given by cynics of what evidence-based healthcare is (the glorification of things that can be measured without regard for the usefulness or accuracy of what is measured, the uncritical acceptance of published numerical data, the preparation of all-encompassing guidelines by self-appointed ‘experts’ who are out of touch with real medicine, the debasement of clinical freedom through the imposition of rigid and dogmatic clinical protocols, and the over-reliance on simplistic, inappropriate and often incorrect economic analyses) are actually criticisms of what the evidence-based healthcare movement is fighting against, rather than of what it represents.

Do not, however, think of me as an evangelist for the gospel according to evidence-based healthcare. I believe that the science of finding, evaluating and implementing the results of clinical research can, and often does, make patient care more objective, more logical and more cost-effective. If I didn’t believe that, I wouldn’t spend so much of my time teaching it and trying, as a doctor, to practise it. Nevertheless, I believe that when applied in a vacuum (that is, in the absence of common sense and without regard to the individual circumstances and priorities of the person being offered treatment or to the complex nature of clinical practice and policy-making), ‘evidence-based’ decision-making is a reductionist process with a real potential for harm.

Finally, you should note that I am neither an epidemiologist nor a statistician, but a person who reads papers and who has developed a pragmatic
---
(and at times unconventional) system for testing their merits. If you wish to pursue the epidemiological or statistical themes covered in this book, I would encourage you to move on to a more definitive text, references for which you will find at the end of each chapter.

# Chapter 1 Why read papers at all?

Does ‘evidence-based medicine’ simply mean ‘reading papers in medical journals’?

Evidence-based medicine (EBM), which is part of the broader field of evidence-based healthcare (EBHC), is much more than just reading papers. According to what is still (more than 20 years after it was written) the most widely quoted definition, it is ‘the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients’ [1]. I find this definition very useful but it misses out what for me is a very important aspect of the subject – and that is the use of mathematics. Even if you know almost nothing about EBHC, you probably know it talks a lot about numbers and ratios! Anna Donald and I decided to be upfront about this in our own teaching, and proposed this alternative definition:

Evidence-based medicine is pe use of mapematical estimates of pe risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in pe diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients.

The defining feature of EBHC, then, is the use of figures derived from research on populations to inform decisions about individuals. This, of course, begs the question ‘What is research?’ – for which a reasonably accurate answer might be ‘Focused, systematic enquiry aimed at generating new knowledge.’ In later chapters, I explain how this definition can help you distinguish genuine research (which should inform your practice) from the poor-quality endeavours of well-meaning amateurs (which you should politely ignore).

If you follow an evidence-based approach to clinical decision-making, therefore, all sorts of issues relating to your patients (or, if you work in public

You might ask questions, for example, about a patient’s symptoms ('In a 34‐year‐old man with left‐sided chest pain, what is the probability that there is a serious heart problem, and, if there is, will it show up on a resting ECG?'), about physical or diagnostic signs ('In an otherwise uncomplicated labour, does the presence of meconium [indicating fetal bowel movement] in the amniotic fluid indicate significant deterioration in the physiological state of the fetus?'), about the prognosis of an illness ('If a previously well 2‐year‐old has a short fit associated with a high temperature, what is the chance that she will subsequently develop epilepsy?'), about therapy ('In patients with an acute coronary syndrome [heart attack], are the risks associated with thrombolytic drugs [clot busters] outweighed by the benefits, whatever the patient’s age, sex and ethnic origin?'), about cost‐effectiveness ('Is the cost of this new anti‐cancer drug justified, compared with other ways of spending limited healthcare resources?'), about patients’ preferences ('In an 87‐year‐old woman with intermittent atrial fibrillation and a recent transient ischaemic attack, do the potential harms and inconvenience of warfarin therapy outweigh the risks of not taking it?') and about a host of other aspects of health and health services.

David Sackett, in the opening editorial of the very first issue of the journal Evidence‐Based Medicine, summarised the essential steps in the emerging science of EBM [2]:

1. To convert our information needs into answerable questions (i.e. to formulate pe problem);
2. To track down, wip maximum efficiency, pe best evidence wip which to answer pese questions – which may come from pe clinical examination, pe diagnostic laboratory, pe published literature or oper sources;
3. To appraise pe evidence critically (i.e. weigh it up) to assess its validity (closeness to pe trup) and usefulness (clinical applicability);
4. To implement pe results of pis appraisal in our clinical practice;
5. To evaluate our performance.

Hence, EBHC requires you not only to read papers, but to read the right papers at the right time and then to alter your behaviour (and, what is often more difficult, influence the behaviour of other people) in the light of what you have found. I am concerned that how‐to‐do‐it courses in EBHC too often concentrate on the third of these five steps (critical appraisal) to the exclusion of all the others. Yet if you have asked the wrong question or sought answers from the wrong sources, you might as well not read any papers at all.

Equally, all your training in search techniques and critical appraisal will go to waste if you do not put at least as much effort into implementing valid evidence and measuring progress towards your goals as you do into reading the paper. A few years ago, I added three more stages to Sackett’s five‐stage model to incorporate the patient’s perspective: the resulting eight stages, which I have called a context‐sensitive checklist for evidence‐based practice, are shown in Appendix 1.

If I were to be pedantic about the title of this book, these broader aspects of EBHC should not even get a mention here. But I hope you would have demanded your money back if I had omitted the final section of this chapter ('Before you start: formulate the problem'), Chapter 2 (Searching the literature) and Chapter 16 (Applying evidence with patients). Chapters 3–15 describe step three of the EBHC process: critical appraisal – that is, what you should do when you actually have the paper in front of you. Chapter 16 deals with common criticisms of EBHC. I have written a separate book on the challenges of implementation, How to Implement Evidence‐Based Healthcare [3].

Incidentally, if you are computer literate and want to explore the subject of EBHC on the Internet, you could try the websites listed in Box 1.1. If you’re not, don’t worry at this stage, but do put learning/use web‐based resources on your to‐do list. Don’t worry either when you discover that there are over 1000 websites dedicated to EBM and EBHC – they all offer very similar material and you certainly don’t need to visit them all.

Why do people sometimes groan when you mention evidence-based healthcare?

Critics of EBHC might define it as ‘the tendency of a group of young, confident and highly numerate medical academics to belittle the performance of experienced clinicians using a combination of epidemiological jargon and statistical sleight-of-hand’ or ‘the argument, usually presented with near-evangelistic zeal, that no health-related action should ever be taken by a doctor, a nurse, a purchaser of health services or a policymaker, unless and until the results of several large and expensive research trials have appeared in print and approved by a committee of experts’.

The resentment amongst some health professionals towards the EBHC movement is mostly a reaction to the implication that doctors (and nurses, midwives, physiotherapists and other health professionals) were functionally illiterate until they were shown the light, and that the few who weren’t illiterate willfully ignored published clinical evidence. Anyone who works face-to-face with patients knows how often it is necessary to seek new information before making a clinical decision. Doctors have spent time in libraries since libraries were invented. In general, we don’t put a patient on a new drug without evidence that it is likely to work. Apart from anything else, such off-license use of medication is, strictly speaking, illegal. Surely we have all been practicing EBHC for years, except when we were deliberately bluffing (using the ‘placebo’ effect for good medical reasons), or when we were ill, overstressed or consciously being lazy?

Well, no, we haven’t. There have been a number of surveys on the behavior of doctors, nurses and related professionals. It was estimated in the 1970s in the USA that only around 10–20% of all health technologies then available (i.e. drugs, procedures, operations, etc.) were evidence-based; that estimate improved to 21% in 1990. Studies of the interventions offered to consecutive series of patients suggested that 60–90% of clinical decisions, depending on the specialty, were ‘evidence-based’ [4]. But such studies had major methodological limitations (in particular, they did not take a particularly nuanced look at whether the patient would have been better off on a different drug or no drug at all). In addition, they were undertaken in specialized units and looked at the practice of world experts in EBHC; hence, the figures arrived at can hardly be generalized beyond their immediate setting (see Chapter 4 ‘Whom is the study about?’). In all probability, we are still selling our patients short most of the time.

A large survey by an Australian team looked at 1000 patients treated for the 22 most commonly seen conditions in a primary care setting. The researchers found that while 90% of patients received evidence-based care for coronary heart disease, only 13% did so for alcohol dependence [5].

Furthermore, the extent to which any individual practitioner provided evidence-based care varied in the sample from 32% of the time to 86% of the time. More recently, a review in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine cited studies of the proportion of doctors’ clinical decisions that were based on strong research evidence; the figure varied from 14% (in thoracic surgery) to 65% (in psychiatry); this paper also reported new data on primary health care, in which around 18% of decisions were based on ‘patient-oriented high-quality evidence’ [6]. Perhaps what is most striking about all these findings is the very wide variation in performance, which ranges from terrible to middling.

Let’s take a look at the various approaches that health professionals use to reach their decisions in reality – all of which are examples of what EBHC isn’t.

Decision-making by anecdote

When I was a medical student, I occasionally joined the retinue of a distinguished professor as he made his daily ward rounds. On seeing a new patient, he would enquire about the patient’s symptoms, turn to the massed ranks of juniors around the bed, and relate the story of a similar patient encountered a few years previously. ‘Ah, yes. I remember we gave her such-and-such, and she was fine after that.’ He was cynical, often rightly, about new drugs and technologies and his clinical acumen was second to none. Nevertheless, it had taken him 40 years to accumulate his expertise, and the largest medical textbook of all – the collection of cases that were outside his personal experience – was forever closed to him.

Anecdote (storytelling) has an important place in clinical practice [7]. Psychologists have shown that students acquire the skills of medicine, nursing and so on by memorising what was wrong with particular patients, and what happened to them, in the form of stories or ‘illness scripts’. Stories about patients are the unit of analysis (i.e. the thing we study) in grand rounds and teaching sessions. Clinicians glean crucial information from patients’ illness narratives – most crucially, perhaps, what being ill means to the patient. And experienced doctors and nurses rightly take account of the accumulated ‘illness scripts’ of all their previous patients when managing subsequent patients. But that doesn’t mean simply doing the same for patient B as you did for patient A if your treatment worked, and doing precisely the opposite if it didn’t!

The dangers of decision-making by anecdote are well illustrated by considering the risk-benefit ratio of drugs and medicines. In my first pregnancy, I developed severe vomiting and was given the anti-sickness drug prochlorperazine (Stemetil). Within minutes, I went into an uncontrollable and very distressing neurological spasm. Two days later, I had recovered fully from

this idiosyncratic reaction, but I have never prescribed the drug since, even though the estimated prevalence of neurological reactions to prochlorperazine is only one in several thousand cases. Conversely, it is tempting to dismiss the possibility of rare but potentially serious adverse effects from familiar drugs – such as thrombosis on the contraceptive pill – when one has never encountered such problems in oneself or one’s patients. We clinicians would not be human if we ignored our personal clinical experiences, but we would be better to base our decisions on the collective experience of thousands of clinicians treating millions of patients, rather than on what we as individuals have seen and felt. Chapter 5 (Statistics for the non‐statistician) describes some more objective methods, such as the number needed to treat (NNT), for deciding whether a particular drug (or other intervention) is likely to do a patient significant good or harm. When the EBM movement was still in its infancy, Sackett emphasised that evidence‐based practice was no threat to old‐fashioned clinical experience or judgement [1]. The question of how clinicians can manage to be both ‘evidence‐based’ (i.e. systematically informing their decisions by research evidence) and ‘narrative‐based’ (i.e. embodying all the richness of their accumulated clinical anecdotes and treating each patient’s problem as a unique illness story rather than as a ‘case of X’) is a difficult one to address philosophically, and beyond the scope of this book. The interested reader might like to look up two articles I’ve written on this topic [8,9].

Decision‐making by press cutting

For the first 10 years after I qualified, I kept an expanding file of papers that I had ripped out of my medical weeklies before binning the less interesting parts. If an article or editorial seemed to have something new to say, I consciously altered my clinical practice in line with its conclusions. All children with suspected urinary tract infections should be sent for scans of the kidneys to exclude congenital abnormalities, said one article, so I began referring anyone under the age of 16 with urinary symptoms for specialist investigations. The advice was in print, and it was recent, so it must surely replace what had been standard practice – in this case, referring only the small minority of such children who display ‘atypical’ features. This approach to clinical decision‐making is still very common. How many clinicians do you know who justify their approach to a particular clinical problem by citing the results section of a single published study, even though they could not tell you anything at all about the methods used to obtain those results? Was the trial randomised and controlled (see Chapter 3 ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’)? How many patients, of what age, sex and disease severity, were involved (see Chapter 4 ‘Whom is the study about’)? How many withdrew from (‘dropped out of ’) the study, and why (see Chapter 4

'Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?' By what criteria were patients judged cured (see Chapter 6 'Surrogate endpoints')? If the findings of the study appeared to contradict those of other researchers, what attempt was made to validate (confirm) and replicate (repeat) them (see Chapter 8 'Ten questions to ask about a paper that claims to validate a diagnostic or screening test')? Were the statistical tests that allegedly proved the authors' point appropriately chosen and correctly performed (see Chapter 5)? Has the patient's perspective been systematically sought and incorporated via a shared decision-making tool (see Chapter 16)? Doctors (and nurses, midwives, medical managers, psychologists, medical students and consumer activists) who like to cite the results of medical research studies have a responsibility to ensure that they first go through a checklist of questions like these (more of which are listed in Appendix 1).

# Decision-making by GOBSAT (good old boys sat around a table)

When I wrote the first edition of this book in the mid-1990s, the most common sort of guideline was what was known as a consensus statement – the fruits of a weekend's hard work by a dozen or so eminent experts who had been shut in a luxury hotel, usually at the expense of a drug company. Such 'GOBSAT (good old boys sat around a table) guidelines' often fell out of the medical freebies (free medical journals and other 'information sheets' sponsored directly or indirectly by the pharmaceutical industry) as pocket-sized booklets replete with potted recommendations and at-a-glance management guides. But who says the advice given in a set of guidelines, a punchy editorial or an amply referenced overview is correct?

Cindy Mulrow [10], one of the founders of the science of systematic review (see Chapter 9), showed a few years ago that experts in a particular clinical field are less likely to provide an objective review of all the available evidence than a non-expert who approaches the literature with unbiased eyes. In extreme cases, an 'expert opinion' may consist simply of the lifelong bad habits and personal press cuttings of an ageing clinician, and a gaggle of such experts would simply multiply the misguided views of any one of them. Table 1.1 gives examples of practices that were at one time widely accepted as good clinical practice (and which would have made it into the GOBSAT guideline of the day), but which have subsequently been discredited by high-quality clinical trials. Indeed, one growth area in EBHC is using evidence to inform disinvestment in practices that were once believed to be evidence-based [11].

Chapter 9 takes you through a checklist for assessing whether a 'systematic review of the evidence' produced to support recommendations for practice or policymaking really merits the description, and Chapter 10 discusses the harm that can be done by applying guidelines that are not evidence-based.

Interestingly, blood‐letting was probably the first practice for which a randomised controlled trial was suggested. The physician van Helmont issued this challenge to his colleagues as early as 1662: ‘Let us take 200 or 500 poor people that have fevers. Let us cast lots, that one half of them may fall to my share, and the others to yours. I will cure them without blood‐letting, but you do as you know – and we shall see how many funerals both of us shall have’ [12]. I am grateful to Matthias Egger for drawing my attention to this example.

It is a major achievement of the EBHC movement that almost no guideline these days is produced by GOBSAT!

Decision-making by cost-minimisation

The popular press tends to be horrified when they learn that a treatment has been withheld from a patient for reasons of cost. Managers, politicians and, increasingly, doctors can count on being pilloried when a child with a rare cancer is not sent to a specialist unit in the USA or an elderly patient is denied a drug to stop her visual loss from macular degeneration. Yet, in the real world, all healthcare is provided from a limited budget and it is increasingly recognised that clinical decisions must take into account the economic costs of a given intervention. As Chapter 11 argues, clinical decision-making purely on the grounds of cost ('cost-minimisation' - purchasing the cheapest option with no regard to how effective it is) is generally ethically unjustified, and we are right to object vocally when this occurs.

Expensive interventions should not, however, be justified simply because they are new, or because they ought to work in theory or because the only alternative is to do nothing - but because they are very likely to save life or significantly improve its quality. How, though, can the benefits of a hip replacement in a 75-year-old be meaningfully compared with that of cholesterol-lowering drugs in a middle-aged man or infertility investigations for a couple in their twenties? Somewhat counter-intuitively, there is no self-evident set of ethical principles or analytical tools that we can use to match limited resources to unlimited demand. As you will see in Chapter 11, the much-derided quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and similar utility-based units are simply attempts to lend some objectivity to the illogical but unavoidable comparison of apples with oranges in the field of human suffering. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (see www.nice.org.uk) seeks to develop both evidence-based guidelines and fair allocation of NHS resources.

There is one more reason why some people find the term evidence-based medicine (or healthcare) unpalatable. This chapter has argued that EBHC is about coping with change, not about knowing all the answers before you start. In other words, it is not so much about what you have read in the past but about how you go about identifying and meeting your ongoing learning needs and applying your knowledge appropriately and consistently in new clinical situations. Doctors who were brought up in the old school style of never admitting ignorance may find it hard to accept that a major element of scientific uncertainty exists in practically every clinical encounter, although in most cases, the clinician fails to identify the uncertainty or to articulate it in terms of an answerable question (see section 'Before you start: formulate the problem'). If you are interested in the research evidence on doctors' (lack of) questioning behaviour, see an excellent review by Swinglehurst [13].

Chapter 1

The fact that none of us – not even the cleverest or most experienced – can answer all the questions that arise in the average clinical encounter means that the ‘expert’ is more fallible than he or she was traditionally cracked up to be. An evidence‐based approach to ward rounds may turn the traditional medical hierarchy on its head when the staff nurse or junior doctor produces new evidence that challenges what the consultant taught everyone last week. For some senior clinicians, learning the skills of critical appraisal is the least of their problems in adjusting to an evidence‐based teaching style!

Having defended EBHC against all the standard arguments put forward by clinicians, I should confess to being sympathetic to many of the more sophisticated arguments put forward by philosophers and social scientists. Such arguments, summarised in Chapter 17, address the nature of knowledge and the question of how much medicine really rests on decisions at all. But please don’t turn to that chapter (which is, philosophically speaking, a ‘hard read’) until you have fully grasped the basic arguments in the first few chapters of this book – or you risk becoming confused!

# Before you start: formulate the problem

When I ask my medical students to write me an essay about high blood pressure, they often produce long, scholarly and essentially correct statements on what high blood pressure is, what causes it and what the different treatment options are. On the day they hand their essays in, most of them know far more about high blood pressure than I do. They are certainly aware that high blood pressure is the single most common cause of stroke, and that detecting and treating everyone’s high blood pressure would cut the incidence of stroke by almost half. Most of them are aware that stroke, although devastating when it happens, is a fairly rare event, and that blood pressure tablets have side effects such as tiredness, dizziness, impotence and getting ‘caught short’ when a long way from the lavatory.

But when I ask my students a practical question such as ‘Mrs Jones has developed light‐headedness on these blood pressure tablets and she wants to stop all medication; what would you advise her to do?’, they are often foxed. They sympathise with Mrs Jones’ predicament, but they cannot distil from their pages of close‐written text the one thing that Mrs Jones needs to know. As Smith (paraphrasing T.S. Eliot) asked a few years ago in a BMJ editorial: ‘Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge, and the knowledge we have lost in information?’[14].

Experienced clinicians might think they can answer Mrs Jones’ question from their own personal experience. As I argued in the previous section, few of them would be right. And even if they were right on this occasion, they would still need an overall system for converting the rag‐bag of information

# Chapter 1

How to read a paper

About a patient (an ill‐defined set of symptoms, physical signs, test results and knowledge of what happened to this patient or a similar patient last time), the particular values and preferences (utilities) of the patient and other things that could be relevant (a hunch, a half‐remembered article, the opinion of a more experienced colleague or a paragraph discovered by chance while flicking through a textbook) into a succinct summary of what the problem is and what specific additional items of information we need to solve that problem.

Sackett and colleagues, in a book subsequently revised by Straus [15], have helped us by dissecting the parts of a good clinical question:

- First, define precisely whom the question is about (i.e. ask ‘How would I describe a group of patients similar to this one?’).
- Next, define which manoeuvre you are considering in this patient or population (e.g. a drug treatment), and, if necessary, a comparison manoeuvre (e.g. placebo or current standard therapy).
- Finally, define the desired (or undesired) outcome (e.g. reduced mortality, better quality of life, and overall cost savings to the health service).

The second step may not concern a drug treatment, surgical operation or other intervention. The manoeuvre could, for example, be the exposure to a putative carcinogen (something that might cause cancer) or the detection of a particular surrogate endpoint in a blood test or other investigation. (A surrogate endpoint, as Chapter 6 ‘Surrogate endpoints’ explains, is something that predicts, or is said to predict, the later development or progression of disease. In reality, there are very few tests that reliably act as crystal balls for patients’ medical future. The statement ‘The doctor looked at the test results and told me I had six months to live’ usually reflects either poor memory or irresponsible doctoring!) In both these cases, the ‘outcome’ would be the development of cancer (or some other disease) several years later. In most clinical problems with individual patients, however, the ‘manoeuvre’ consists of a specific intervention initiated by a health professional.

Thus, in Mrs Jones’ case, we might ask, ‘In a 68‐year‐old white woman with essential (i.e. common or garden) hypertension (high blood pressure), no coexisting illness and no significant past medical history, whose blood pressure is currently X/Y, do the benefits of continuing therapy with bendroflumethiazide (chiefly, reduced risk of stroke) outweigh the inconvenience?’ Note that in framing the specific question, we have already established that Mrs Jones has never had a heart attack, stroke or early warning signs such as transient paralysis or loss of vision. If she had, her risk of subsequent stroke would be much higher and we would, rightly, load the risk–benefit equation to reflect this.

Chapter 1

In order to answer the question we have posed, we must determine not just the risk of stroke in untreated hypertension, but also the likely reduction in that risk which we can expect with drug treatment. This is, in fact, a rephrasing of a more general question (do the benefits of treatment in this case outweigh the risks?) which we should have asked before we prescribed bendroflumethiazide to Mrs Jones in the first place, and which all doctors should, of course, ask themselves every time they reach for their prescription pad.

Remember that Mrs Jones’ alternative to staying on this particular drug is not necessarily to take no drugs at all; there may be other drugs with equivalent efficacy but less disabling side effects (as Chapter 6 argues, too many clinical trials of new drugs compare the product with placebo rather than with the best available alternative), or non-medical treatments such as exercise, salt restriction, homeopathy or yoga. Not all of these approaches would help Mrs Jones or be acceptable to her, but it would be quite appropriate to seek evidence as to whether they might help her – especially if she was asking to try one or more of these remedies.

We will probably find answers to some of these questions in the medical literature, and Chapter 2 describes how to search for relevant papers once you have formulated the problem. But before you start, give one last thought to your patient with high blood pressure. In order to determine her personal priorities (how does she value a 10% reduction in her risk of stroke in 5 years’ time compared to the inability to go shopping unaccompanied today?), you will need to approach Mrs Jones, not a blood pressure specialist or the Medline database! Chapter 16 sets out some structured approaches for doing this.

# Chapter 2 Searching the literature

Evidence is accumulating faster than ever before, and staying up-to-date is essential to ensure the best patient care. Studies and reviews of studies of clinicians’ information-seeking behaviour confirm that textbooks and personal contacts continue to be the most favoured sources for clinical information, followed by journal articles (see, e.g. Davies [1]). Use of the Internet as an information resource has increased dramatically in recent years, especially via PubMed/Medline, but the sophistication of searching and the efficiency in finding answers has not grown apace. Ask any medical librarian and you will hear tales of important clinical questions being addressed using unsystematic Google searches. While the need of healthcare professionals for information of the best quality has never been greater, barriers abound: lack of time, lack of facilities, lack of searching skills, lack of motivation and (perhaps worst of all) information overload [2].

The medical literature is far more of a jungle today than it was when the first edition of this book was published in 1996. The volume and complexity of published literature has grown: Medline alone has over 20 million references. While Medline is the flagship database for journal articles in the health sciences, it is a very conservative resource, slow to pick up new journals or journals published outside the USA, so there are many thousands of high-quality papers that may be available via other databases but are not on Medline. The proliferation of databases makes the information jungle that much more confusing, especially because each database covers its own range of journals and each has its own particular search protocols. How will you cope?

There is hope: in the past few years, the information ‘jungle’ has been tamed by means of information highways and high-speed transit systems. Knowing how to access these navigational wonders will save you time and improve your ability to find the best evidence. The purpose of this chapter is

# Searching the literature

not to teach you to become an expert searcher, but rather to help you recognise the kinds of resources that are available, choose intelligently among them and put them to work directly.

# Chapter 2

What are you looking for?

A searcher approaches medical (and, more broadly, health science) literature for three broad purposes:

1. Informally, almost recreationally, browsing to keep current and to satisfy our intrinsic curiosity.
2. Focused, looking for answers, perhaps related to questions that have occurred in clinic or that arise from individual patients and their questions.
3. Surveying the existing literature, perhaps before embarking on a research project.

Each approach involves searching in a very different way.

Browsing has an element of serendipity about it. In the old days, we would pick up our favourite journal and follow where our fancy took us. And if our fancy was informed with a few tools to help us discriminate the quality of papers we found, so much the better. These days, we can make use of new tools to help us with our browsing. We can browse electronic journals just as easily as paper journals; we can use alerting services to let us know when a new issue has been published and even tell us if articles matching our interest profile are in that issue. We can have Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds of articles from particular journals or on particular topics sent to our e‐mail addresses or our iPhones or personal blogs, and we can participate in Twitter exchanges related to newly published papers. Almost every journal has links from its home page allowing at least one of these social networking services. These technologies are changing continuously. Those of us who have been faced with deluges of new offprints, photocopies and journal issues we have been meaning to read will be happy to learn that we can create the same chaos electronically. That is what browsing serendipitously is all about, and it is a joy we should never lose, in whatever medium our literature may be published.

Looking for answers implies a much more focused approach, a search for an answer we can trust to apply directly to the care of a patient. When we find that trustworthy information, it is OK to stop looking – we don’t need to beat the bush for absolutely every study that may have addressed this topic. This kind of query is increasingly well served by new synthesised information sources whose goal is to support evidence‐based care and the transfer of research findings into practice. This is discussed further later.

# Chapter 2

How to read a paper

Surveying the literature – preparing a detailed, broad‐based and thoughtful literature review, for example, when writing an essay for an assignment or an article for publication – involves an entirely different process. The purpose here is less to influence patient care directly than to identify the existing body of research that has addressed a problem and clarify the gaps in knowledge that require further research. For this kind of searching, a strong knowledge of information resources and skill in searching them are fundamental. A simple PubMed search will not suffice. Multiple relevant databases need to be searched systematically, and citation chaining (see subsequent text) needs to be employed to assure that no stone has been left unturned. If this is your goal, you must consult with an information professional (health librarian, clinical informaticist, etc.).

Levels upon levels of evidence

The term level of evidence refers to what degree that information can be trusted, based on study design. Traditionally, and considering the most common type of question (relating to therapy), levels of evidence are represented as a pyramid with systematic reviews positioned grandly at the top, followed by well‐designed randomised controlled trials, then observational studies such as cohort studies or case–control studies, with case studies, bench (laboratory) studies and ‘expert opinion’ somewhere near the bottom (Figure 2.1). All this is described in more detail later in this book.

# Chapter 2

My librarian colleagues, who are often keen on synthesised evidence and technical resources for decision support, remind me of a rival pyramid, with computerised decision support systems (abbreviated ‘systems’) at the top, above evidence-based practice guidelines, followed by systematic review synopses, with standard systematic reviews beneath these, and so on [3]. Whether we think in terms of the first (traditional) evidence pyramid or the second (more contemporary) one, the message is clear: all evidence, all information, is not necessarily equivalent. We need to keep a sharp eye out for the believability of whatever information we find, wherever we find it.

# Synthesised sources: systems, summaries and syntheses

Information resources synthesised from primary studies constitute a very high level of evidence indeed. These resources exist to help translate research into practice and inform clinician and patient decision-making. This kind of evidence is relatively new (at least, compared to traditional primary research studies, which have been with us for centuries), but their use is expected to grow considerably as they become better known.

Systematic reviews are perhaps the oldest and best known of the synthesised sources, having started in the 1980s under the inspiration of Archie Cochrane, who bemoaned the multiplicity of individual clinical trials whose information failed to provide clear messages for practice. The original efforts to search broadly for clinical trials on a topic and pool their results statistically grew into the Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com) in the mid-1990s; Cochrane Reviews became the gold standard for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Collaboration the premier force for developing and improving review methodology [4].

There are many advantages to systematic reviews and a few cautions. On the plus side, systematic reviews are relatively easy to interpret. The systematic selection and appraisal of the primary studies according to an approved protocol means that bias is minimised. Smaller studies, which are all too common in some topic areas, may show a trend towards positive impact but lack statistical significance. But when data from several small studies are summed mathematically in a process called meta-analysis, the combined data may produce a statistically significant finding (see Chapter 9 ‘Meta-analysis for the non-statistician’). Systematic reviews can help resolve contradictory findings among different studies on the same question. If the systematic review has been properly conducted, the results are likely to be robust and generalisable. On the negative side, systematic reviews can replicate and magnify flaws in the original studies (e.g. if all the primary studies considered a drug at sub-therapeutic dose, the overall – misleading – conclusion may be that the drug has ‘no effect’). Cochrane Reviews can be a daunting read, but
---
# Chapter 2

How to read a paper

Here’s a tip. The bulk of a Cochrane Review consists of methodological discussion: the gist of it can be gleaned by jumping to the ‘Plain Language Summary’, always to be found directly following the abstract. Alternatively, you can gain a quick and accurate summary by looking at the pictures – especially something called a forest plot, which graphically displays the results of each of the primary studies along with the combined result. Chapter 9 explains systematic reviews in more detail.

Cochrane Reviews are only published electronically, but other systematic reviews appear throughout the clinical literature. They are most easily accessed via the Cochrane Library, which publishes Cochrane Reviews, DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, listed in Cochrane Library as ‘Other reviews’), and a database of Health Technology Assessments (HTAs). DARE provides not only a bibliography of systematic reviews, but also a critical appraisal of most of the reviews included, making this a ‘pre‐appraised source’ for systematic reviews. HTAs are essentially systematic reviews but range further to consider economic and policy implications of drugs, technologies and health systems. All can be searched relatively simply and simultaneously via the Cochrane Library.

In the past, Cochrane Reviews focused mainly on questions of therapy (see Chapter 6) or prevention, but since 2008 considerable effort has gone into producing systematic reviews of diagnostic tests (see Chapter 8).

Point‐of‐care resources are rather like electronic textbooks or detailed clinical handbooks, but explicitly evidence‐based, continuously updated and designed to be user‐friendly – perhaps the textbook of the future. Three popular ones are BMJ Best Practice, DynaMed and Essential Evidence Plus. All of these aspire to be firmly evidence‐based, peer‐reviewed, revised regularly and with links to the primary research incorporated into their recommendations.

|BMJ Best Practice|https://bestpractice.bmj.com/info/evidence‐information/|a British resource (for which a subscription is required), draws on systematic reviews to provide very quick information, especially on the comparative value of tests and interventions. Reviews are organised into sections, such as Child Health or Skin Disorders; or you can search the database by keyword (e.g. ‘asthma’) or by a full review list. In each clinical area, there are sections for doctors, nurses, pharmacists and patients.|
|---|---|---|
|DynaMed|https://dynamed.com/home/|produced in the USA, is rather more like a handbook with chapters covering a wide variety of disorders, but with summaries of clinical research, levels of evidence and links to the|

primary articles. It covers causes and risks, complications and associated conditions (including differential diagnosis), what to look for in the history and physical examination, what diagnostic tests to do, prognosis, treatment, prevention and screening and links to patient information handouts. You can search very simply for the condition: the results include links to other chapters about similar conditions. This is a proprietary resource (i.e. you generally have to pay for it), although it may be provided free to those who offer to write a chapter themselves!

Chapter 2

- Essential Evidence Plus (http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/) is another subscription-only US-based resource put together by EBM-savvy doctors and aimed at the busy front-line clinician. It includes a searchable database of clinical topics and a daily POEM ('patient oriented evidence that matters'). Check to see if your organisation has institutional membership!

All the above resources have applications (apps) that allow use on smartphones, which improve their bedside usability for patient care. New point‐of‐care resources are continually emerging, so it is very much a matter of individual preference which you use. The three listed were chosen because they are peer‐reviewed, regularly updated and directly linked to the primary evidence.

Practice Guidelines, covered in detail in Chapter 10, are 'systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare for specific clinical circumstances' [5]. In a good guideline, the scientific evidence is assembled systematically, the panel developing the guideline includes representatives from all relevant disciplines, including patients, and the recommendations are explicitly linked to the evidence from which they are derived [6]. Guidelines are a summarised form of evidence, very high on the hierarchy of pre‐appraised resources, but the initial purpose of the guideline should always be kept in mind: guidelines for different settings and different purposes can be based on the same evidence but come out with different recommendations.

Guidelines are readily available from a variety of sources, including the following.

- National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, www.nice.org.uk) is a UK‐government‐funded agency responsible for developing evidence‐based guidelines and other evidence summaries to support national health policy. NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries (https://cks.nice.org.uk), based closely on NICE guidelines, are designed especially for those working in primary health care.

# Chapter 2

How to read a paper

National Guideline Clearinghouse (https://www.ahrq.gov/gam/index.html) is an initiative of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services. Although a government-funded US database, National Geographic Channel (NGC) is international in content. An advantage of this resource is that different guidelines purporting to cover the same topic can be directly compared on all points, from levels of evidence to recommendations. All guidelines must be current and revised every 5 years, although at the time of writing the AHRQ has lost federal funding and is no longer updating the guideline site.

A straightforward and popular way to search practice guidelines is via TRIP (Turning Research into Practice, www.tripdatabase.com), a federated search engine discussed later in this chapter. For guidelines, look in the box panel to the right of the screen following a simple search on TRIP: a heading ‘guidelines’ appears, with subheadings for Australian and New Zealand, Canadian, UK, USA and Other, and a number indicting the number of guidelines found on that topic. NICE and National Guideline Clearinghouse are included among the guidelines searched.

Pre-appraised sources: synopses of systematic reviews and primary studies

If your topic is more circumscribed than those covered in the synthesised or summary sources listed, or if you are simply browsing to keep current with the literature, consider one of the pre-appraised sources as a means of navigating through those millions of articles in our information jungle. The most common format is the digest of clinical research articles gleaned from core journals and deemed to provide important information for patient care: Evidence-Based Medicine, ACP Journal Club, Evidence-Based Mental Health and POEMS (Patient-Oriented Evidence that Matters). Some are free, some are available through institutions or memberships or private subscription. All of them have a format that includes a structured abstract and a brief critical appraisal of the article’s content. Studies included may be single studies or systematic reviews. Each is considered a pre-appraised source, and critical appraisal aside, simple inclusion has implications for the perceived quality and importance of the original article.

All of these sources can be considered as small databases of select studies, which can be searched by keyword. Other selected journal article services, such as Evidence Updates, provide abstracts plus an indication of level of interest each article might hold for particular disciplines.
---
# Searching the literature

DARE was mentioned as a pre‐appraised source for systematic reviews other than Cochrane Reviews, in that it provides an augmented abstract and a brief critical appraisal for most systematic reviews in its database.

Another source that is considered pre‐appraised, although it contains no appraisals, is the Central Register of Controlled Trials, also part of the Cochrane Library. ‘Central’ is a bibliography of studies included in Cochrane Reviews, as well as in new studies on similar topics, maintained by the various Cochrane Review Groups. DARE, Central, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the HTA database and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database – which also includes critically appraised summaries of studies – can be searched simultaneously in the Cochrane Library.

# Specialised resources

Specialised information sources, organised (as the name implies) to assist the specialist doctor in a particular field, are often also useful for generalists, specialist nurses and primary care clinicians. Most professional associations maintain excellent websites with practice guidelines, journal links and other useful information resources; most require membership in the association to access educational and practice materials. Two notable examples that are available for a fee are Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) and Psychiatry Online.

|GIDEON|Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network, www.gideononline.com|an evidence‐based programme that assists with diagnosis and treatment of communicable diseases. In addition, GIDEON tracks incidence and prevalence of diseases worldwide and includes the spectrum covered by antibiotic agents.|
|---|---|---|
|Psychiatry Online|https://psychiatryonline.org|a compendium of core textbooks (including Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM‐5)), psychiatry journals and practice guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association, produced by the American Psychiatric Press.|

These two are only examples. Whatever your specialty (or specialist topic), there will usually be a similar resource maintained by a professional society. Ask a librarian or clinical informaticist to help you find the relevant one.

# Primary studies – tackling the jungle

Whether through habit or through lack of familiarity with all the useful synthesised, summarised or pre‐appraised sources described earlier, most health practitioners still prefer a basic search of Medline/PubMed to answer

their clinical information needs. Some simply prefer to assess the primary literature for themselves, without thumbnail critical appraisals or incorporation into larger disease management chapters. Primary sources can be found in a variety of ways. You could look at the reference lists and hyperlinks from the secondary sources described. You could identify them from journals – for example, via RSS feeds, table-of-contents services or more focused topical information services. And you could search databases such as PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PASCAL, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (Cumulated Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Biosis Previews, Web of Science, Scopus or Google or Google Scholar. Let’s consider these in turn.

PubMed is the most frequently accessed Internet resource for most physicians and health professionals worldwide, probably because it is free and well-known (just put ‘PubMed’ into Google and you will find it easily). Most people opt for the basic PubMed search, using two or three search text words at best – and characteristically turning up hundreds or thousands of references, of which they look at only the first couple of screens. This is certainly not the most efficient way to search, but it is the reality of how most people do search [7]. Interestingly, when just one or two more search terms are added, the efficiency of a basic PubMed search improves substantially [7]. Simple tools that are part of the Medline search engine can be used to help focus a search and produce better results for a basic search, but they are rarely used by medical students or doctors. One such tool is the ‘limit’ function, allowing restrictions to such generic topics as gender, age group or study design; to language; or to core clinical journals. The advanced search function on PubMed incorporates these limits into a single search page. Next time you are on the PubMed website with some time to spare, play with these tools and see how easily they can sharpen your search.

‘Clinical queries’, an option provided in the left-hand panel of the basic PubMed screen or at the bottom of the advanced search screen, superimposes on the search a filter based on optimum study designs for best evidence, depending on the domain of the question and the degree to which one wishes to focus the question. For example, if you were searching for a therapy study for hypercholesterolaemia, the clinical query for therapy/narrow and specific would be rendered as ‘(hypercholesterolaemia) AND (randomised controlled trial [Publication Type] OR (randomised [Title/Abstract] AND controlled [Title/Abstract] AND trial [Title/Abstract]))’. In this instance, the search might need further limits or perhaps the addition of a second term, such as a specific drug, because the result is over 2000 postings.

Citation chaining (or, to use its alternative term, citation tracking) provides another means of following a topic. Let’s say that following your interest in

# Searching the literature

hypercholesterolaemia, you wish to follow up a classic primary research study, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, originally published in the 1990s [8]. In your PubMed search, you found a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2007 that described a 10‐year follow‐up [9], but you now wonder if there has been anything further. The databases Web of Science, comprising Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index online, provide a cited reference search feature. Entering the author’s name (in this case I. Ford) and the year of publication (2007), we can trace the specific article, and find that several hundred articles published since have cited it in their reference lists, including at least one 20‐year follow‐up study [10]. Citation searching can give a crude indication of the relative importance of a study, based on the number of times it has been cited (bearing in mind that one sometimes cites a paper when emphasising how bad it is!). A very simple (but somewhat less accurate) way of citation chaining is to use Google Scholar: simply put the article’s title into this search engine and when you have found it, select ‘citations’.

Google Scholar, a very broad‐based web browser, is increasingly popular and extremely handy, accessible as it is from the Google toolbar. For an obscure topic, Google Scholar can be an excellent resource on which to fall back, as it will identify papers that are listed on PubMed as well as those that aren’t. Unfortunately, there are no quality filters (such as clinical queries), no limits (such as gender or age), so a search on a widely researched topic will tend to turn up a long list of hits that you have no alternative but to wade through.

# One‐stop shopping: federated search engines

Perhaps the simplest and most efficient answer for most clinicians searching for information for patient care is a federated search engine such as TRIP, (www.tripdatabase.com), which searches multiple resources simultaneously and has the advantage of being free.

TRIP has a truly primitive search engine, but it searches synthesised sources (systematic reviews including Cochrane Reviews), summarised sources (including practice guidelines from North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand and elsewhere, as well as electronic textbooks) and pre‐appraised sources (such as the journals Evidence‐Based Medicine and Evidence‐Based Mental Health), as well as searching all clinical query domains in PubMed simultaneously. Moreover, searches can be limited by discipline, such as Paediatrics or Surgery, helping to focus a search and eliminate clearly irrelevant results and acknowledging the tendency of medical specialists to (rightly or wrongly) prefer the literature in their own journals. Given that most clinicians favour very simple searches, a TRIP search may well get you the maximum bang for your buck.

Asking for help and asking around

If a librarian fractured his or her wrist, he or she would have no hesitation in seeking out a physician. Similarly, a healthcare professional doesn’t need to cope with the literature alone. Health librarians are readily available in universities, hospitals, government departments and agencies and professional societies. They know the databases available, they know the complexities of searching, they know the literature (even complex government documents and obscure datasets) and they usually know just enough about the topic to have an idea of what you are looking for and levels of evidence that are likely to be found. When one librarian can’t find an answer, there are colleagues with whom he or she can and will consult, locally, nationally and internationally. Librarians of the 21st century are exceptionally well networked!

Asking people you know yourself or know about has its advantages. Experts in the field are often aware of unpublished research or reports commissioned by government or other agencies – notoriously hard-to-find ‘grey’ or ‘fugitive’ literature that is not indexed in any source. An international organised information-sharing organisation CHAIN (Contact, Help, Advice and Information Network, www.chain-network.org.uk) provides a useful online network for people working in health and social care who wish to share information. CHAIN is free to join and, once a member, you can pitch in a question and target it to a designated group of specialists.

In a field as overwhelming and complex as health information, asking colleagues and people you trust has always been a preferred source for information. In the early days of evidence-based medicine (EBM), asking around was seen as unsystematic and ‘biased’. It remains true that asking around is insufficient for a search for evidence, but in the light of the ability of experts to locate obscure literature, can any search really be considered complete without it?

Online tutorials for effective searching

Many universities and other educational institutions now provide self-study tutorials, which you can access via computer – either on an intranet (for members of the university only) or the Internet (accessible to everyone). Here are some I found when revising this chapter for the fifth edition. Note that as with all Internet-based sources, some sites will move or close down, so I apologise in advance if you find a dead link:

There are many other similar tutorials accessible free on the Internet, but few of them cover much beyond searching for primary studies and systematic reviews in PubMed and the Cochrane Library.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. If you were a busy geriatrician and keen to stay updated on the latest developments in your specialty, which sources of evidence would you use? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of each of them?
2. Explore the TRIP database (www.tripdatabase.com or put ‘Trip Database’ into Google) as an example of a powerful federated search engine. Put a term into the search box (for example,‘gestational diabetes’) and hit the search button. Now look down the right‐hand column and see what the site offers you in terms of systematic reviews, evidence‐based synopses, guidelines and key primary research.
3. Explore the Cochrane Library and find a Cochrane Review on a topic of your choice. The easiest way to get there is put ‘Cochrane Library’ into Google. On the home page, you can browse by broad category of topic, or you can use the search engine to look for more specific topics. Skim through an entire review (they’re often very long) to get a feel for how these reviews are structured. Many of the recent ones have useful patient (lay) summaries which are short and relatively jargon‐free.

# Chapter 3 Getting your bearings: what is this paper about?

The science of ‘trashing’ papers

It usually comes as a surprise to students to learn that some published articles, the purists would say up to 99%, belong in the bin, and should certainly not be used to inform practice. In 1979, Stephen Lock, the editor of the British Medical Journal, wrote ‘Few things are more dispiriting to a medical editor than having to reject a paper based on a good idea but with irremediable flaws in the methods used.’ Fifteen years later, Altman was still claiming that only 1% of medical research was free of methodological flaws [1], and in 2005 John Ioannidis published his classic paper, ‘Why most published research findings are false’ [2]. Box 3.1 shows the main flaws that lead to papers being rejected, and which are present to some degree in many that are published.

Most papers appearing in medical journals are presented more or less in standard format: introduction, methods, research and discussion (IMRAD). Introduction (why the authors decided to do this particular piece of research); methods (how they did it, and how they chose to analyse their results); results (what they found); and discussion (what they think the results mean). If you are deciding whether a paper is worth reading, you should do so on the design of the methods section, and not on the interest value of the hypothesis, the nature or potential impact of the results or the speculation in the discussion.

Conversely, bad science is bad science regardless of whether the study addressed an important clinical issue, whether the results are ‘statistically significant’, whether things changed in the direction you would have liked them to and whether the findings promise immeasurable benefits for patients or savings for the health service. Strictly speaking, if you are going to trash a paper, you should do so before you even look at the results.

It is much easier to pick holes in other people’s work than to carry out a methodologically perfect piece of research oneself. When I teach critical appraisal, there is usually someone in the group who finds it profoundly discourteous to criticise research projects into which dedicated scientists have put the best years of their lives. I remind these students that scholarly critique is not the same as gratuitous criticism. There may also be good practical reasons why the authors of the study have not performed a perfect study, and they know as well as you do that their work would have been more scientifically valid if this or that (anticipated or unanticipated) difficulty had not arisen during the course of the study.

Most good scientific journals send papers out to a referee for comments on their scientific validity, originality and importance before deciding whether to publish them. This process is known as peer review, and much has been written about it [3]. Common defects picked up by referees are listed in Box 3.1.

The assessment of methodological quality (critical appraisal) has been covered in detail in the widely cited series ‘Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature’ originally published in the Journal of the American Medical

Association (universally known as JAMA). JAMA’s structured guides on how
to read papers on therapy, diagnosis, screening, prognosis, causation, quality
of care, economic analysis, systematic review, qualitative research and so on
are regarded by many as the definitive checklists for critical appraisal.
Appendix 1 lists some simpler checklists I have derived from the Users’ Chapter 3
Guides and the other sources cited at the end of this chapter, together with
some ideas of my own. If you are an experienced journal reader, these checklists will be largely self‐explanatory. But if you still have difficulty getting
started when looking at a medical paper, try asking the preliminary questions
in the next section.

# Three preliminary questions to get your bearings

Question One: Why was the study needed – and what
was the research question?

The introductory sentence of a research paper should state, in a nutshell,
what the background to the research is. For example, ‘Grommet insertion is
a common procedure in children with glue ear, and it has been suggested
that not all operations are clinically necessary, since most children grow out
of the problem without surgical treatment.’ This statement should be
followed by a brief review of the published literature, for example, ‘Gupta and
Brown’s prospective survey of grommet insertions demonstrated that…’ . It is
irritatingly common for authors to forget to place their research in context,
as the background to the problem is usually clear as daylight to them by the
time they reach the writing‐up stage. Be warned – the authors may selectively
cite only some papers and even misrepresent what those studies found in
order to justify their own research. If in doubt, do a literature search yourself
(see Chapter 2).

The last sentence of the introduction (or occasionally somewhere early in
the methods section) should state clearly the research question and/or the
hypothesis that the authors have decided to test. For example: ‘This study
aimed to determine whether insertion of grommets was more effective and
safer than watchful waiting.’

You may find that the research question has inadvertently been omitted,
or, more commonly, that the information is buried somewhere mid‐
paragraph. If the main research hypothesis is presented in the negative
(which it usually is), such as ‘The addition of metformin to maximal dose
sulphonylurea therapy will not improve the control of type 2 diabetes’, it is
known as a null hypothesis. The authors of a study rarely actually believe their
null hypothesis when they embark on their research. Being human, they have
usually set out to demonstrate a difference between the two arms of their
study. But the way scientists do this is to say ‘let’s assume there’s no difference;
---
# Chapter 3

How to read a paper

Now let’s try to disprove that theory’. If you adhere to the teachings of philosopher of science Karl Popper, this hypotheticodeductive approach (setting up falsifiable hypotheses that you then proceed to test) is the very essence of the scientific method [4]. If you have not discovered what the authors’ research question was by the time you are halfway through the methods section, you may find it in the first paragraph of the discussion. Remember, however, that not all research studies (even good ones) are set up to test a single definitive hypothesis. Qualitative research studies, which (so long as they are well‐designed and well‐conducted) are as valid and as necessary as the more conventional quantitative studies, aim to look at particular issues in a broad, open‐ended way in order to illuminate issues; generate or modify hypotheses and prioritize areas to investigate. This type of research is discussed further in Chapter 12. Even quantitative research (which most of the rest of this book is about) is now seen as more than hypothesis‐testing. In general, it is preferable to talk about evaluating the strength of evidence around a particular issue than about proving or disproving hypotheses.

Question Two: What was the research design?

First, decide whether the paper describes a primary or secondary study. Primary studies report research first‐hand, while secondary studies attempt to summarize and draw conclusions from primary studies. Primary studies (sometimes known as empirical studies) are the stuff of most published research in medical journals, and usually fall into one of these categories:

- Laboratory experiments, in which a maneuver is performed on an animal or a volunteer in artificial and controlled surroundings.
- Comparative clinical trials, a form of experiment in which an intervention – either simple (such as a drug; see Chapter 6) or complex (such as an educational program; see Chapter 7) – is offered to a group of participants (i.e. the patients included in the trial) who are then followed up to see what happens to them.
- Surveys, in which something is measured in a group of participants (patients, health professionals or some other sample of individuals). Questionnaire surveys (see Chapter 13) measure people’s opinions, attitudes and self‐reported behaviors.
- Organizational case studies, in which the researcher tells a story that tries to capture the complexity of a change effort (e.g. an attempt to implement evidence; see Chapter 14).
- Cohort studies, in which a group of individuals is followed up to see what happens to them (an example of a cohort study is the ‘big data’ variety typically involving many thousands of people, see Chapter 15).

The more common types of clinical trials and surveys are discussed in the later sections of this chapter. Make sure you understand any jargon used in describing the study design (Table 3.1).

Secondary research includes the following study types:

- Overviews, which are considered in Chapter 9, can be divided into:
1. (non-systematic) reviews, which summarise primary studies;
2. systematic reviews, which do this using a rigorous, transparent and auditable (i.e. checkable) method;
3. meta-analyses, systematic reviews that include a statistical technique to integrate the numerical data from more than one study.
- Guidelines, which are considered in Chapter 10, draw conclusions from primary studies about how clinicians should be behaving.
- Economic analyses, which are considered briefly in Chapter 12 and in more detail elsewhere [6], use the results of primary studies to say whether a particular course of action is a good use of resources.

Question Three: Was the research design appropriate to the question?

Examples of the sort of questions that can reasonably be answered by different types of primary research study are given in the sections that follow. One question that frequently cries out to be asked is this: was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) the best method of addressing this particular research question, and if the study was not an RCT, should it have been? Before you jump to any conclusions, decide what broad field of research the study covers (Box 3.2). Once you have done this, ask whether the study design was appropriate to this question. For more help on this task (which people often find difficult until they get the hang of it) see the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) website (https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford‐centre‐for‐evidence‐based‐medicine).

|Box 3.2|Broad fields of research|
|---|---|
|Therapy|testing the efficacy of drug treatments, surgical procedures, alternative methods of service delivery or other interventions. Preferred study design is randomised controlled trial (see section ‘Randomised controlled trials’ and Chapters 6 and 7).|
|Diagnosis|demonstrating whether a new diagnostic test is valid (can we trust it?) and reliable (would we get the same results every time?). Preferred study design is cross‐sectional survey (see section ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’ and Chapter 8).|
|Screening|demonstrating the value of tests that can be applied to large populations and that pick up disease at a pre‐symptomatic stage. Preferred study design is cross‐sectional survey (see section ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’ and Chapter 8).|
|Prognosis|determining what is likely to happen to someone whose disease is picked up at an early stage. Preferred study design is longitudinal survey (see section ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’).|
|Causation|determining whether a putative harmful agent, such as environmental pollution, is related to the development of illness. Preferred study design is cohort or case–control study, depending on how rare the disease is (see sections ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’ and ‘Case reports’), but case reports (see section ‘The traditional hierarchy of evidence’) can also provide crucial information.|
|Psychometric studies|measuring attitudes, beliefs or preferences, often about the nature of illness or its treatment.|

Qualitative studies are discussed in Chapter 12.

Getting your bearings: what is this paper about?

Randomised controlled trials

In an RCT, participants in the trial are randomly allocated by a process equivalent to the flip of a coin to either one intervention (such as a drug treatment) or another (such as placebo treatment – or more commonly, best current therapy). Both groups are followed up for a pre‐specified time period and analysed in terms of specific outcomes defined at the outset of the study (e.g. death, heart attack or serum cholesterol level). Because, on average, the groups are identical apart from the intervention, any differences in outcome are, in theory, attributable to the intervention. In reality, however, not every RCT is a bowl of cherries.

Some papers that report trials comparing an intervention with a control group are not, in fact, randomised trials at all. The terminology for these is other controlled clinical trials – a term used to describe comparative studies in which participants were allocated to intervention or control groups in a non‐random manner. This situation can arise, for example, when random allocation would be impossible, impractical or unethical – for example, when patients on ward A receive one diet while those on ward B receive a different diet. (Although this design is inferior to the RCT, it is much easier to execute, and was used successfully a century ago to demonstrate the benefit of brown rice over white rice in the treatment of beriberi [7].) The problems of non‐random allocation are discussed further in Chapter 4 ‘Was bias avoided or minimised?’ in relation to determining whether the two groups in a trial can reasonably be compared with one another on a statistical level.

Some trials count as a sort of halfway house between true randomised trials and non‐randomised trials. In these, randomisation is not performed truly at random (e.g. using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes each with a computer‐generated random number inside), but by some method that allows the clinician to know which group the patient would be in before he or she makes a definitive decision to randomise the patient. This allows subtle biases to creep in, as the clinician might be more (or less) likely to enter a particular patient into the trial if he or she believed that this individual would get active treatment. In particular, patients with more severe disease may be subconsciously withheld from the placebo arm of the trial. Examples of unacceptable methods include randomisation by last digit of date of birth (even numbers to group A, odds to group B), toss of a coin (heads to group A, tails to group B), sequential allocation (patient A to group 1; patient B to group 2, etc.) and date seen in clinic (all patients seen this week to group A; all those seen next week to group 2, etc.) (Box 3.3).

Listed here are examples of clinical questions that would be best answered by an RCT, but note also the examples in the later sections of this chapter of situations where other types of studies could or must be used instead.
---
# Chapter 3

|Box 3.3|Advantages of the randomised controlled trial design|
|---|---|
|1|Allows rigorous evaluation of a single variable (e.g. effect of drug treatment versus placebo) in a precisely defined patient group (e.g. post-menopausal women aged 50–60 years).|
|2|Prospective design (i.e. data are collected on events which happen after you decide to do the study).|
|3|Uses hypothetico-deductive reasoning (i.e. seeks to falsify, rather than confirm, its own hypothesis; see section ‘Three preliminary questions to get your bearings’).|
|4|Potentially eradicates bias by comparing two otherwise identical groups (but see subsequent text and Chapter 4 ‘Was bias avoided or minimised?’).|
|5|Allows for meta-analysis (combining the numerical results of several similar trials) at a later date; see Chapter 8 ‘Ten questions to ask about a paper that claims to validate a diagnostic or screening test’.|

- Is this drug better than a placebo or a different drug for a particular disease?
- Is a new surgical procedure better than the currently favoured practice?
- Is an online decision support algorithm better than verbal advice in helping patients make informed choices about the treatment options for a particular condition?
- Will changing from a diet high in saturated fats to one high in polyunsaturated fats significantly affect serum cholesterol levels?

RCTs are often said to be the gold standard in medical research. Up to a point, this is true (see section ‘The traditional hierarchy of evidence’), but only for certain types of clinical questions (Box 3.2 and see sections ‘Cohort studies’, ‘Case–control studies’, ‘Cross-sectional surveys’ and ‘Case reports’). The questions that best lend themselves to the RCT design relate to interventions, and are mainly concerned with therapy or prevention. It should be remembered, however, that even when we are looking at therapeutic interventions, and especially when we are not, there are a number of important disadvantages associated with randomised trials (Box 3.4).

Remember, too, that the results of an RCT can have limited applicability as a result of selection bias (selection of trial participants from a group that is unrepresentative of everyone with the condition), uptake bias (limited interest in the study, or ability to participate in it, from certain key groups), performance bias (differences in what is provided to the groups over and above the intervention being tested), detection bias (differences between the

|Box 3.4|Disadvantages of the randomised controlled trial design|
|---|---|
| |Expensive and time‐consuming, hence, in practice:|
| |• Many RCTs are either never carried out, are performed on too few patients or are undertaken for too short a period (see Chapter 4 ‘Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?’);|
| |• Most RCTs are funded by large research bodies (university or government sponsored) or drug companies, who ultimately dictate the research agenda;|
| |• Surrogate endpoints may not reflect outcomes that are important to patients (see Chapter 6 ‘Surrogate endpoints’).|
| |May introduce ‘hidden bias’, especially through:|
| |• Imperfect randomisation (see examples in text);|
| |• Failure to randomise all eligible patients (clinician only offers participation in the trial to patients he or she considers will respond well to the intervention);|
| |• Failure to blind assessors to randomisation status of patients (see Chapter 4 ‘Was assessment “blind”?’).|

Groups in how the outcomes are assessed), attrition bias (when one group has many more withdrawals or ‘drop‐outs’ than the other) and publication bias (selective publication of positive results, often but not always because the organisation that funded the research stands to gain or lose depending on the findings) [8]. These biases are discussed further in Chapter 4.

Note also that analysis of only pre‐defined ‘objective’ endpoints which may exclude important qualitative aspects of the intervention (see Chapter 12) and may include only the outcomes that matter most to patients (see Chapter 16). Furthermore, RCTs can be well or badly managed [2], and, once published, their results are open to distortion by an over‐enthusiastic scientific community or by a public eager for a new wonder drug. While all these problems might also occur with other trial designs, they can be particularly pertinent when an RCT is being sold to you as, methodologically speaking, whiter than white [9,10].

There are, in addition, many situations in which RCTs are unnecessary, impractical or inappropriate.

RCTs are unnecessary

- When a clearly successful intervention for an otherwise fatal condition is discovered.
- When a previous RCT or meta‐analysis has given a definitive result (either positive or negative). Arguably, it is actually unethical to ask patients to be randomised to a clinical trial without first conducting a systematic literature review to see whether the trial needs to be carried out at all.

# Chapter 3

How to read a paper

RCTs are impractical

- Where it would be unethical to seek consent to randomise.
- Where the number of participants needed to demonstrate a significant difference between the groups is prohibitively high.

RCTs are inappropriate

- Where the study is looking at the prognosis of a disease. For this analysis, the appropriate route to best evidence is a longitudinal survey of a properly assembled inception cohort.
- Where the study is looking at the validity of a diagnostic or screening test. For this analysis, the appropriate route to best evidence is a cross‐sectional survey of patients clinically suspected of harboring the relevant disorder.
- Where the study is looking at a ‘quality of care’ issue in which the criteria for ‘success’ have not yet been established. For example, an RCT comparing medical with surgical methods of abortion might assess ‘success’ in terms of number of patients achieving complete evacuation, amount of bleeding and pain level. However, the patients might decide that other aspects of the procedure are important, such as knowing in advance how long the procedure will take, not seeing or feeling the abortus come out, and so on. For this analysis, the appropriate route to best evidence is qualitative research methods (see Chapter 12).

All these issues have been discussed in great depth by clinical epidemiologists, who remind us that to turn our noses up at the non‐randomized trial can indicate scientific naivety and not, as many people routinely assume, intellectual rigor. You might also like to look up the emerging science of pragmatic RCTs – a methodology for taking account of practical, real‐world challenges so that the findings of your trial will be more relevant to that real world when the trial is finished [11]. See also Chapter 6 where I introduce the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for presenting the findings of RCTs.

Cohort studies

In a cohort study, two (or more) groups of people are selected on the basis of differences in their exposure to a particular agent (such as a vaccine, a surgical procedure or an environmental toxin), and followed up to see how many in each group develop a particular disease, complication or other outcome. The follow‐up period in cohort studies is generally measured in years (and sometimes in decades) because that is how long many diseases, especially cancer, take to develop. Note that RCTs are usually begun on people who

already have a disease, whereas most cohort studies are begun on people who may or may not develop disease.

A special type of cohort study can also be used to determine the prognosis of a disease (i.e. what is likely to happen to someone who has it). A group of people who have all been diagnosed as having an early stage of the disease or a positive screening test (see Chapter 7) is assembled (the inception cohort) and followed up on repeated occasions to see the incidence (new cases per year) and time course of different outcomes. (Here is a definition that you should commit to memory if you can: incidence is the number of new cases of a disease per year, whereas prevalence is the overall proportion of the population who have the disease.)

The world’s most famous cohort study, whose authors all won knighthoods, was undertaken by Sir Austen Bradford Hill, Sir Richard Doll and, latterly, Sir Richard Peto. They followed up 40,000 male British doctors divided into four cohorts (non-smokers, and light, moderate and heavy smokers) using both all-cause (any death) and cause-specific (death from a particular disease) mortality as outcome measures. Publication of their 10-year interim results in 1964 [12], which showed a substantial excess in both lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in smokers, with a ‘dose-response’ relationship (i.e. the more you smoke, the worse your chances of getting lung cancer), went a long way to demonstrating that the link between smoking and ill health was causal rather than coincidental. The 20-year [13], 40-year [14] and 50-year [15] results of this momentous study (which achieved an impressive 94% follow-up of those recruited in 1951 and not known to have died) illustrate both the perils of smoking and the strength of evidence that can be obtained from a properly conducted cohort study.

These are the clinical questions that should be addressed by a cohort study.

- Does smoking cause lung cancer?
- Does the contraceptive pill ‘cause’ breast cancer? (Note, once again, that the word ‘cause’ is a loaded and potentially misleading term. As John Guillebaud argued in his excellent book The Pill and Other Forms of Hormonal Contraception [16], if a thousand women went on the oral contraceptive pill tomorrow, some of them would get breast cancer. But some of those would have got it anyway. The question that epidemiologists try to answer through cohort studies is, ‘what is the additional risk of developing breast cancer which this woman would run by taking the pill, over and above the baseline risk attributable to her own hormonal balance, family history, diet, alcohol intake, and so on?’.)
- Does high blood pressure get better over time?
- What happens to infants who have been born very prematurely, in terms of subsequent physical development and educational achievement?

# Chapter 3

How to read a paper

Since the first edition of this book appeared, cohort studies have undergone a quiet revolution, due partly to the exponential increase in computer power that has occurred in the past generation (and particularly the facility to link with electronic patient records) and partly to the emergence of population genetics (see Chapter 15). Whereas 20 years ago, respectability in research circles seemed to be based almost exclusively on whether one was currently conducting a randomised controlled trial (and while clinical trials are still very important), these days the well‐dressed quantitative researcher is also expected to talk about his or her ‘cohort’, which is usually known by a catchy acronym and includes several thousand patients being followed up over time. My boss, Richard Hobbs, for example, is a quantitative researcher based at the University of Oxford. His collection of cohorts includes OXVASC (around 10,000 people who have had an acute stroke), OXVALVE (6000 older people with screen‐detected heart valve problems) and OXREN (3250 older people with chronic kidney disease). Google them to find out more.

Case–control studies

In a case–control study, patients with a particular disease or condition are identified and ‘matched’ with controls (patients with some other disease, the general population, neighbours or relatives). Data are then collected (e.g. by searching back through these people’s medical records, or by asking them to recall their own history) on past exposure to a possible causal agent for the disease. Like cohort studies, case–control studies are generally concerned with the aetiology of a disease (i.e. what causes it), rather than its treatment. They lie lower down the conventional hierarchy of evidence (in other words, they are a weaker form of evidence than RCTs or cohort studies), but this design is usually the only option when studying rare conditions – and it also offers options in genetic association studies (see Chapter 15). An important source of difficulty (and potential bias) in a case–control study is the precise definition of who counts as a ‘case’, because one misallocated individual can substantially influence the results (see Chapter 4 ‘Was bias avoided or minimised?’). In addition, such a design cannot demonstrate causality – in other words, the association of A with B in a case–control study does not prove that A has caused B.

Clinical questions that should be addressed by a case–control study include the following:

- Does the prone sleeping position increase the risk of cot death (sudden infant death syndrome) in babies?
- Does whooping cough vaccine cause brain damage?
- Did eating at a particular pizza restaurant in a particular time period cause hepatitis A?
---
# Cross‐sectional surveys

We have probably all been asked to take part in a survey, even if it was only a woman in the street asking us which brand of toothpaste we prefer. Surveys conducted by epidemiologists are run along essentially the same lines: a representative sample of participants is recruited and then interviewed, examined or otherwise studied to gain answers to a specific clinical (or other) question. In cross‐sectional surveys, data are collected at a single time point but may refer retrospectively to health experiences in the past – for example, the study of patients’ medical records to see how often their blood pressure has been recorded in the past 5 years.

A cross‐sectional survey should address the following clinical questions:

- What is the ‘normal’ height of a 3‐year‐old child? This, like other questions about the range of normality, can be answered simply by measuring the height of enough healthy 3‐year‐olds. But such an exercise does not answer the related clinical question ‘When should an unusually short child be investigated for disease?’ because, as in almost all biological measurements, the physiological (normal) overlaps with the pathological (abnormal). This problem is discussed further in Chapter 8 ‘A note on likelihood ratios’.
- What do psychiatric nurses believe about the value of antidepressant drugs and talking therapies in the treatment of severe depression?
- Is it true that ‘half of all cases of diabetes are undiagnosed’? This an example of the more general question, ‘What is the prevalence (proportion of people with the condition) of this disease in this community?’ The only way of finding the answer is to carry out the definitive diagnostic test on a representative sample of the population.

# Case reports

A case report describes the medical history of a single patient in the form of a story (‘Mrs B is a 54‐year‐old secretary who developed chest pain in June 2010’). Case reports are often run together to form a case series, in which the medical histories of more than one patient with a particular condition are described to illustrate an aspect of the condition, the treatment or, most commonly these days, adverse reaction to treatment.

Although this type of research is traditionally considered to be weak scientific evidence, a great deal of information that would be lost in a clinical trial or survey can be conveyed in a case report. In addition, case reports are immediately understandable by non‐academic clinicians and by the lay public. They can, if necessary, be written up and published within days, which gives them a definite edge over clinical trials (whose gestation period.

You can run into years) or meta‐analyses (even longer). And the clinical case is the unit of learning (doctors learn medicine, and nurses nursing, by accumulating and reflecting on individual cases). There are certainly good theoretical grounds for the reinstatement of the humble case report as a useful and valid contribution to medical science, not least because the story is one of the best vehicles for making sense of a complex clinical situation.

The following are clinical situations in which a case report or case series is an appropriate type of study:

- A doctor notices that two babies born in his hospital have absent limbs (phocomelia). Both mothers had taken a new drug (thalidomide) in early pregnancy. The doctor wishes to alert his or her colleagues worldwide to the possibility of drug‐related damage as quickly as possible [17]. (Anyone who thinks ‘quick and dirty’ case reports are never scientifically justified should remember this example.)
- A patient who went undiagnosed with chronic pain and fatigue for years was subsequently found to have an unusual presentation of a rare disease. The team caring for him or her decide to write this story up as a lesson for other clinicians [18].

The traditional hierarchy of evidence

Standard notation for the relative weight carried by the different types of primary study when making decisions about clinical interventions (the ‘hierarchy of evidence’) puts them in the following order:

1. Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses;
2. RCTs with definitive results (i.e. confidence intervals that do not overlap the threshold clinically significant effect; see Chapter 5 ‘Probability and confidence’);
3. RCTs with non‐definitive results (i.e. a point estimate that suggests a clinically significant effect but with confidence intervals overlapping the threshold for this effect; see Chapter 5 ‘Probability and confidence’);
4. Cohort studies;
5. Case–control studies;
6. Cross‐sectional surveys;
7. Case reports.

The pinnacle of the hierarchy is, quite properly, reserved for secondary research papers, in which all the primary studies on a particular subject have been hunted out and critically appraised according to rigorous criteria.

# Getting your bearings: what is this paper about?

(see Chapter 9). Note, however, that not even the most hard‐line protagonist
of EBM would place a sloppy meta‐analysis or an RCT that was seriously
methodologically flawed above a large, well‐designed cohort study. And as
Chapter 12 shows, many important and valid studies in the field of qualita-
tive research do not feature in this particular hierarchy of evidence at all.

# Chapter 3

In other words, evaluating the potential contribution of a particular study
to medical science requires considerably more effort than is needed to check
off its basic design against the 7‐point scale. A more recent publication on
hierarchies of evidence suggests we should grade studies on four dimensions:
risk of bias, consistency, directness and precision – an approach that would
complicate any simple pyramid of evidence [19]. The take‐home message is,
don’t apply the hierarchy of evidence mechanically – it’s only a rule of thumb.

A more complex representation of the hierarchy of evidence geared to the
domain of the question (therapy/prevention, diagnosis, harm, prognosis) was
drawn up by a group of us in 2011 [20] and is available for download on the
Centre for Evidence Based Medicine website (https://www.cebm.net/2016/05/ocebm‐levels‐of‐evidence/). But before you look that one up, make sure you
are clear on the traditional (basic) hierarchy described in this section.

# Chapter 4 Assessing methodological quality

As I argued in the previous chapter, a paper will sink or swim on the strength of its methods section. This chapter considers five essential questions which should form the basis of your decision to ‘bin’ it outright (because of fatal methodological flaws), interpret its findings cautiously (because the methods were less than robust) or trust it completely (because you can’t fault the methods at all). Five important questions – was the study original, whom is it about, was it well designed, was bias avoided (i.e. was the study adequately ‘controlled’) and was it large enough and continued for long enough to make the results credible – are considered in turn.

Was the study original?

There is, in theory, no point in testing a scientific hypothesis that someone else has already proved one way or the other. But in real life, science is seldom so cut and dried. Only a tiny proportion of medical research breaks entirely new ground, and an equally tiny proportion repeats exactly the steps of previous workers. The majority of research studies will tell us (if they are methodologically sound) that a particular hypothesis is slightly more or less likely to be correct than it was before we added our piece to the wider jigsaw. Hence, it may be perfectly valid to do a study that is, on the face of it, ‘unoriginal’. Indeed, the whole science of meta‐analysis depends on there being more than one study in the literature that has addressed the same question in pretty much the same way.

The practical question to ask, then, about a new piece of research, is not ‘has anyone ever conducted a similar study before?’ but ‘does this new research add to the literature in any way?’ A list of such examples is given here.

How to read a paper

- Is this study bigger, continued for longer or otherwise more substantial than the previous one(s)?
- Are the methods of this study any more rigorous (in particular, does it address any specific methodological criticisms of previous studies)?
- Will the numerical results of this study add significantly to a meta‐analysis of previous studies?
- Is the population studied different in any way (e.g. has the study looked at different ethnic groups, ages or gender than have previous studies)?
- Is the clinical issue addressed of sufficient importance, and does there exist sufficient doubt in the minds of the public or key decision‐makers, to make new evidence ‘politically’ desirable even when it is not strictly scientifically necessary?

Whom is the study about?

One of the first papers that ever caught my eye was entitled ‘But will it help my patients with myocardial infarction?’ [1]. I don’t remember the details of the article, but it opened my eyes to the fact that research on someone else’s patients may not have a take‐home message for my own practice. This is not mere xenophobia. The main reasons why the participants (Sir Iain Chalmers has argued forcefully against calling them ‘patients’) [2] in a clinical trial or survey might differ from patients in ‘real life’ are listed here.

1. They were more, or less, ill than the patients you see.
2. They were from a different ethnic group, or lived a different lifestyle, from your own patients.
3. They received more (or different) attention during the study than you could ever hope to give your patients.
4. Unlike most real‐life patients, they had nothing wrong with them apart from the condition being studied.
5. None of them smoked, drank alcohol or were taking the contraceptive pill.

Hence, before swallowing the results of any paper whole, here are some questions that you should ask yourself.

1. How were the participants recruited? If you wanted to do a questionnaire survey of the views of users of the hospital accident and emergency department, you could recruit respondents by putting an ad in the local newspaper. However, this method would be a good example of recruitment bias because the sample you obtained would be skewed in favour of users who were highly motivated to answer your questions and liked to read newspapers. You would do better to issue a questionnaire to every user (or to a one in ten sample of users) who turned up on a particular day.

# Assessing methodological quality

2. Who was included in the study? In the past, clinical trials routinely excluded people with coexisting illness, those who did not speak English, those taking certain other medication and people who could not read the consent form. This approach may be experimentally clean but, because clinical trial results will be used to guide practice in relation to wider patient groups, it is actually scientifically flawed. The results of pharmacokinetic studies of new drugs in 23-year-old healthy male volunteers will clearly not be applicable to women over 80 (most of whom have at least one other coexisting illness). A number of recent papers (see for example this one from oncology [3]) have revealed the biases against older people and those with comorbidities in the design of clinical trials. As a result, in most conditions we still don’t have a reliable evidence base for how to treat the over-80s.

3. Who was excluded from the study? For example, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) may be restricted to patients with moderate or severe forms of a disease such as heart failure – a policy that could lead to false conclusions about the treatment of mild heart failure. This has important practical implications when clinical trials performed on hospital outpatients are used to dictate ‘best practice’ in primary care, where the spectrum of disease is generally milder.

4. Were the participants studied in ‘real-life’ circumstances? For example, were they admitted to hospital purely for observation? Did they receive lengthy and detailed explanations of the potential benefits of the intervention? Were they given the telephone number of a key research worker? Did the company who funded the research provide new equipment that would not be available to the ordinary clinician? These factors would not invalidate the study, but they may cast doubts on the applicability of its findings to your own practice.

# Was the design of the study sensible?

Although the terminology of research trial design can be forbidding, much of what is grandly termed critical appraisal is plain common sense. Personally, I assess the basic design of a clinical trial via two questions.

1. What specific intervention or other manoeuvre was being considered, and what was it being compared with? This is one of the most fundamental questions in appraising any paper. It is tempting to take published statements at face value, but remember that authors may misrepresent (usually subconsciously rather than deliberately) what they actually did, and overestimate its originality and potential importance. In the examples in Table 4.1, I have used hypothetical statements so as not to cause offence, but they are all based on similar mistakes seen in print.

2. What outcome was measured, and how? If you had an incurable disease, for which a pharmaceutical company claimed to have produced a new wonder drug, you would measure the efficacy of the drug in terms of whether it made you live longer (and, perhaps, whether life was worth living given your condition and any side effects of the medication). You would not be too interested in the levels of some obscure enzyme in your blood that the manufacturer assured you were a reliable indicator of your chances of survival. The use of such surrogate endpoints is discussed further in Chapter 6.

The measurement of symptomatic (e.g. pain), functional (e.g. mobility), psychological (e.g. anxiety) or social (e.g. inconvenience) effects of an intervention is fraught with even more problems. The methodology of developing, administering and interpreting such ‘soft’ outcome measures is beyond the scope of this book. But, in general, you should always look for evidence in the paper that the outcome measure has been objectively validated – that is, that someone has demonstrated that the ‘outcome measure’ used in the study has been shown to measure what it purports to measure, and that changes in this outcome measure adequately reflect changes in the status of the patient. Remember that what is important in the eyes of the doctor may not be valued so highly by the patient, and vice versa. One of the most exciting developments in evidence‐based medicine (EBM) in recent years is the emerging science of patient‐reported outcome measures (see Chapter 16 ‘PROMs’).

Was bias avoided or minimised?
Bias is defined by epidemiologists as anything that systematically influences the conclusions about groups and distorts comparisons [4]. Whether the design of a study is an RCT, a non‐randomised comparative trial, a cohort study or a case–control study, the aim should be for the groups being compared to be as like one another as possible except for the particular difference being examined. They should, as far as possible, receive the same explanations, have the same contacts with health professionals and be assessed the same number of times by the same assessors, using the same outcome measures [5,6]. Different study designs call for different steps to reduce bias.

Randomised controlled trials
In an RCT, bias is (in theory) avoided by selecting a sample of participants from a particular population and allocating them randomly to the different groups. Chapter 3 ‘Randomised controlled trials’ describes some ways in which bias can creep into even this gold standard of clinical trial design, and Figure 4.1 summarises particular sources to check for.

# Chapter 4

| |Intervention group|Control group|
|---|---|---|
|Selection bias (systematic differences in the comparison groups attributable to incomplete randomisation)|Exposed to intervention|Not exposed to intervention|
|Performance bias (systematic differences in the care provided apart from the intervention being evaluated)| | |
|Attrition bias (systematic differences in withdrawals from the trial)|Follow-up|Follow-up|
|Detection bias (systematic differences in outcome assessment)|Outcomes|Outcomes|

Figure 4.1 Sources of bias to check for in a randomised controlled trial.

Non-randomised controlled clinical trials

I once chaired a seminar in which a multidisciplinary group of students from the medical, nursing, pharmacy and allied professions were presenting the results of several in-house research studies. All but one of the studies presented were of comparative, but non-randomised, design – that is, one group of patients (say, hospital outpatients with asthma) had received one intervention (say, an educational leaflet), while another group (say, patients attending general practitioner (GP) surgeries with asthma) had received another intervention (say, group educational sessions). I was surprised how many of the presenters believed that their study was, or was equivalent to, an RCT. In other words, these commendably enthusiastic and committed young researchers were blind to the most obvious bias of all: they were comparing two groups that had inherent, self-selected differences even before the intervention was applied (as well as having all the additional potential sources of bias listed in Figure 4.1 for RCTs).

As a general rule, if the paper you are looking at is a non-randomised controlled clinical trial, you must decide if the baseline differences between
---
# Assessing methodological quality

The intervention and control groups are likely to have been so great as to invalidate any differences ascribed to the effects of the intervention. This is, in fact, almost always the case. Sometimes, the authors of such a paper will list the important features of each group (such as mean age, sex ratio and markers of disease severity) in a table to allow you to compare these differences yourself. For a formal checklist on assessing the quality of non-randomised comparative studies, see this paper [7].

# Chapter 4

Cohort studies

In the previous chapter, I mentioned the ‘quiet revolution’ in cohort studies that has occurred in the past few years. It remains the case that the RCT is ideally the best way to assess whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But for various reasons (cost being one, computer power being another), observational studies in which nobody is randomised have become more popular. In the expanding field of comparative effectiveness studies (assessing which of two or more treatments is best in a particular condition) for example, observational studies comparing one naturally occurring cohort to another are now commonplace. For a discussion on the benefits and trade-offs of such studies, see these papers [8,9].

The selection of a comparable control group is one of the most difficult decisions facing the authors of an observational (cohort or case–control) study. Few cohort studies succeed in identifying two groups of subjects who are equal in age, gender mix, socioeconomic status, presence of coexisting illness and so on, with the single difference being their exposure to the agent being studied. In practice, much of the ‘controlling’ in cohort studies occurs at the analysis stage, where complex statistical adjustment is made for baseline differences in key variables. Unless this is performed adequately, statistical tests of probability and confidence intervals (see Chapter 5) will be dangerously misleading.

This problem is illustrated by the various cohort studies on the risks and benefits of alcohol, which have consistently demonstrated a J-shaped relationship between alcohol intake and mortality. The best outcome (in terms of premature death) lies with the cohort group who are moderate drinkers [10]. Self-confessed teetotallers, it seems, are significantly more likely to die young than the average person who drinks three or four drinks a day.

But can we assume that teetotallers are, on average, identical to moderate drinkers except for the amount they drink? We certainly can’t. As we all know, the teetotal population includes those who have been ordered to give up alcohol on health grounds (‘sick quitters’), those who, for health or other reasons, have cut out a host of additional items from their diet and lifestyle, those from certain religious or ethnic groups which would be under-represented in the other cohorts (notably Muslims and Seventh Day Adventists) and those who drink like fish but choose to lie about it.
---
# Chapter 4

The details of how these different features of teetotalism were controlled for by the epidemiologists are discussed elsewhere [9,10]. Interestingly, when I was writing the third edition of this book in 2005, the conclusion at that time was that even when due allowance was made in the analysis for potential confounding variables in people who described themselves as non‐drinkers, these individuals’ increased risk of premature mortality remained (i.e. the ‘J‐curve’ was a genuine phenomenon) [10].

But by the time I wrote the fourth edition in 2010, a more sophisticated analysis of the various cohort studies (i.e. which controlled more carefully for ‘sick quitters’) had been published [11]. It showed that, all other things being equal, teetotallers are no more likely to contract heart disease than moderate drinkers (hence, the famous ‘J‐curve’ may have been an artefact all along). Subsequently, a new meta‐analysis purported to show that the J‐curve was a genuine phenomenon and alcohol was indeed protective in small quantities [12] – but a year later a new analysis of the same primary studies came to the opposite conclusion, having placed more weight on so‐called methodological flaws [13]. And a further meta‐analysis a few years later by the same authors suggests that this conclusion still holds for this (sixth) edition of How to Read a Paper [14]. The protective effect of moderate alcohol intake is one of the best examples of the challenges of correcting for bias in non‐randomised studies; you might like to discuss it with your EBM colleagues over a beer.

If you’re looking for a definitive checklist for the quality of observational studies (both cohort and case–control), I recommend the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) Statement [15].

# Case–control studies

In case–control studies (in which the experiences of individuals with and without a particular disease are analysed retrospectively to identify exposure to possible causes of that disease), the process most open to bias is not the assessment of outcome, but the diagnosis of ‘caseness’ and the decision as to when the individual became a case.

A good example of this occurred a few years ago when legal action was brought against the manufacturers of the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine, which was alleged to have caused neurological damage in a number of infants [16]. In order to answer the question ‘Did the vaccine cause brain damage?’, a case–control study had been undertaken in which a ‘case’ was defined as an infant who, previously well, had exhibited fits or other signs suggestive of brain damage within one week of receiving the vaccine. A control was an infant of the same age and sex taken from the same immunisation register, who had received immunisation and who may or may not have developed symptoms at some stage.
---
New onset of features of brain damage in apparently normal babies is extremely rare, but it does happen, and the link with recent immunisation could conceivably be coincidental. Furthermore, heightened public anxiety about the issue could have biased the recall of parents and health professionals so that infants whose neurological symptoms predated, or occurred some time after, the administration of pertussis vaccine might be wrongly classified as cases. The judge in the court case ruled that misclassification of three such infants as ‘cases’ rather than controls led to the overestimation of the harm attributable to whooping cough vaccine by a factor of three. Although this ruling has subsequently been challenged, the principle stands – that assignment of ‘caseness’ in a case–control study must be performed rigorously and objectively if bias is to be avoided.

Was assessment ‘blind’?

Even the most rigorous attempt to achieve a comparable control group will be wasted effort if the people who assess outcome (e.g. those who judge whether someone is still clinically in heart failure, or who say whether an X‐ray is ‘improved’ from last time) know which group the patient they are assessing was allocated to. If you believe that the evaluation of clinical signs and the interpretation of diagnostic tests such as ECGs and X‐rays is 100% objective, you haven’t been in the game very long [17].

The chapter ‘The Clinical Examination’ in Sackett and colleagues’ book Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine [18] provides substantial evidence that when examining patients, doctors find what they expect and hope to find. It is rare for two competent clinicians to reach complete agreement for any given aspect of the physical examination or interpretation of any diagnostic test. The level of agreement beyond chance between two observers can be expressed mathematically as the Kappa score, with a score of 1.0 indicating perfect agreement. Kappa scores for specialists in the field assessing the height of a patient’s jugular venous pressure, classifying diabetic retinopathy from retinal photographs and interpreting a mammogram X‐ray, were, respectively, 0.42, 0.55 and 0.67 [18].

This digression into clinical disagreement should have persuaded you that efforts to keep assessors ‘blind’ (or, to avoid offence to the visually impaired, masked), to the group allocation of their patients are far from superfluous. If, for example, I knew that a patient had been randomised to an active drug to lower blood pressure rather than to a placebo, I might be more likely to recheck a reading that was surprisingly high. This is an example of performance bias, which, along with other pitfalls for the unblinded assessor, are listed in Figure 4.1.

An excellent example of controlling for bias by adequate ‘blinding’ was published in The Lancet a few years ago [19]. Majeed and colleagues

performed an RCT that demonstrated, in contrast with the findings of several previous studies, that the recovery time (days in hospital, days off work and time to resume full activity) after laparoscopic removal of the gallbladder (the keyhole surgery approach) was no quicker than that associated with the traditional open operation. The discrepancy between this trial and its predecessors may have been because of the authors’ meticulous attempt to reduce bias (see Figure 4.1). The patients were not randomised until after induction of general anaesthesia. Neither the patients nor their carers were aware of which operation had been performed, as all patients left the operating theatre with identical dressings (complete with blood stains!). These findings challenge previous authors to ask themselves whether it was expectation bias, rather than swifter recovery, which spurred doctors to discharge the laparoscopic surgery group earlier. The ethical issues surrounding sham operations are complex; see this paper for more detail on that topic [20].

Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?

As a non-statistician, I tend only to look for three numbers in the methods section of a paper. While strictly speaking, many other things are also important, these three will get you started:

a. The size of the sample;

b. The duration of follow-up; and

c. The completeness of follow-up.

Sample size

A crucial prerequisite before embarking on a clinical trial is to perform a sample size ('power') calculation. A trial should be big enough to have a high chance of detecting, as statistically significant, a worthwhile effect if it exists, and thus to be reasonably sure that no benefit exists if it is not found in the trial.

In order to calculate sample size, the researcher must ascertain two things.

1. The level of difference between the two groups that would constitute a clinically significant effect. Note that this may not be the same as a statistically significant effect. To cite an example from a famous clinical trial of hypertension therapy, you could administer a new drug that lowered blood pressure by around 10 mmHg, and the effect would be a statistically significant lowering of the chances of developing stroke (i.e. the odds are less than 1 in 20 that the reduced incidence occurred by chance) [21]. However, if the people being asked to take this drug had only mildly raised

# Assessing methodological quality

blood pressure and no other major risk factors for stroke (i.e. they were relatively young, not diabetic, had normal cholesterol levels, etc.), this level of difference would only prevent around one stroke in every 850 patients treated – a clinical difference in risk which many patients would classify as not worth the hassle of taking the tablets. This was shown over 20 years ago – and confirmed by numerous studies since (see a recent Cochrane Review [22]). Yet far too many doctors still treat their patients according to the statistical significance of the findings of mega trials rather than the clinical significance for their patient.

# Chapter 4

2. The mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the principal outcome variable.

If the outcome in question is an event (such as hysterectomy) rather than a quantity (such as blood pressure), the items of data required are the proportion of people experiencing the event in the population, and an estimate of what might constitute a clinically significant change in that proportion. Once these items of data have been ascertained, the minimum sample size can be easily computed using standard formulae, nomograms or tables, which can be obtained from published papers [23], textbooks [24], free access websites (try www.macorr.com/sample‐size‐calculator.htm) or commercial statistical software packages (see, for example, https://www.ncss.com/pass/). Hence, the researchers can, before the trial begins, work out how large a sample they will need in order to have a moderate, high or very high chance of detecting a true difference between the groups. The likelihood of detecting a true difference is known as the power of the study. It is common for studies to stipulate a power of between 80% and 90%. Hence, when reading a paper about an RCT, you should look for a sentence that reads something like this (which is taken from Majeed and colleagues’ cholecystectomy paper described earlier) [19].

For a 90% chance of detecting a difference of one night’s stay in hospital using the Mann–Whitney U‐test [see Chapter 5, Table 5.1], 100 patients were needed in each group (assuming SD of 2 nights). This gives a power greater than 90% for detecting a difference in operating times of 15 minutes, assuming a SD of 20 minutes.

If the paper you are reading does not give a sample size calculation and it appears to show that there is no difference between the intervention and control arms of the trial, you should extract from the paper (or directly from the authors) the information in (a) and (b) earlier and do the calculation yourself. Underpowered studies are ubiquitous in the medical literature, usually because the authors found it harder than they anticipated to recruit

# Chapter 4

How to read a paper

Duration of follow-up

Even if the sample size itself was adequate, a study must be continued for long enough for the effect of the intervention to be reflected in the primary outcome variable. If the authors were looking at the effect of a new painkiller on the degree of postoperative pain, their study may only have needed a follow-up period of 48 h. On the other hand, if they were looking at the effect of nutritional supplementation in the preschool years on final adult height, follow-up should have been measured in decades.

Even if the intervention has demonstrated a significant difference between the groups after, say, 6 months, that difference may not be sustained. As many dieters know from bitter experience, strategies to reduce obesity often show dramatic results after 2 or 3 weeks, but if follow-up is continued for a year or more, the unfortunate participants have (more often than not) put most of the weight back on.

Completeness of follow-up

It has been shown repeatedly that participants who withdraw from research studies are less likely to have taken their tablets as directed, more likely to have missed their interim check-ups and more likely to have experienced side effects on any medication, than those who do not withdraw (incidentally, don’t use the term dropout as this is pejorative). People who fail to complete questionnaires may feel differently about the issue (and probably less strongly) than those who send them back by return of post. People on a weight-reducing programme are more likely to continue coming back if they are actually losing weight.

The following are among the reasons patients withdraw (or are withdrawn by the researchers) from clinical trials:

|1.|Incorrect entry of patient into trial (i.e. researcher discovers during the trial that the patient should not have been randomized in the first place because he or she did not fulfill the entry criteria).|
|---|---|
|2.|Suspected adverse reaction to the trial drug. Note that you should never look at the ‘adverse reaction’ rate in the intervention group without comparing it with that on placebo. Inert tablets bring people out in a rash surprisingly frequently.|
|3.|Loss of participant motivation (‘I don’t want to take these tablets anymore’ – but more often ‘I don’t want to keep coming back to clinic and filling out long questionnaires’).|

4. Clinical reasons (e.g. concurrent illness, pregnancy).

5. Loss to follow‐up (e.g. participant moves away).

6. Death. Clearly, people who die will not attend for their outpatient appoint-ments, so unless specifically accounted for they might be misclassified as withdrawals. This is one reason why studies with a low follow‐up rate (say, below 70%) are generally considered untrustworthy.

Ignoring everyone who has failed to complete a clinical trial will bias the results, usually in favour of the intervention. It is, therefore, standard practice to analyse the results of comparative studies on an intent‐to‐treat basis. This means that all data on participants originally allocated to the intervention arm of the study, including those who withdrew before the trial finished, those who did not take their tablets and even those who subsequently received the control intervention for whatever reason, should be analysed along with data on the patients who followed the protocol throughout. Conversely, withdrawals from the placebo arm of the study should be analysed with those who faithfully took their placebo. If you look hard enough in a paper, you will usually find the sentence, ‘results were analysed on an intent‐to‐treat basis’, but you should not be reassured until you have checked and confirmed the figures yourself.

There are, in fact, a few situations when intent‐to‐treat analysis is, rightly, not used. The most common is the efficacy (or per‐protocol) analysis, which is to explain the effects of the intervention itself, and is therefore of the treatment actually received. But even if the participants in an efficacy analysis are part of an RCT, for the purposes of the analysis they effectively constitute a cohort study (see section ‘Cohort studies’).

# A note on ethical considerations

When I was a junior doctor, I got a job in a world‐renowned teaching hospital. One of my humble tasks was seeing the geriatric (elderly) patients in the accident and emergency department. I was soon invited out to lunch by two charming mid‐career doctors, who (I later realised) were seeking my help with their research. In return for getting my name on the paper, I was to take a rectal biopsy (i.e. cut out a small piece of tissue from the rectum) on any patient over the age of 90 who had constipation. I asked for a copy of the consent form that patients would be asked to sign. When they assured me that the average 90‐year‐old would hardly notice the procedure, I smelt a rat and refused to cooperate with their project.

Consideration of ethical issues is both a criminal offence and potential grounds for a doctor to be ‘struck off ’ the medical register. Getting formal ethical approval for one’s research study (for UK readers, see www.corec.org.uk), and ensuring that the research is properly run and adequately monitored (a set of tasks and responsibilities known as research governance) can be an enormous bureaucratic hurdle. Ethical issues were, sadly, sometimes ignored in the past in research in babies, the elderly, those with learning difficulties and those unable to protest (e.g. prisoners and the military), leading to some infamous research scandals.

These days, most editors routinely refuse to publish research that has not been approved by a research ethics committee. Note, however, that heavy‐handed approaches to research governance by official bodies may be ethically questionable. Neurologist and researcher Charles Warlow argued some years ago that the overemphasis on ‘informed consent’ by well‐intentioned research ethics committees has been the kiss of death to research into head injuries, strokes and other acute brain problems (in which, clearly, the person is in no position to consider the personal pros and cons of taking part in a research study) [25]. More recently, exasperated researchers published a salutary tale entitled ‘Bureaucracy stifles medical research in Britain’ [26]. The bottom line message for this book is: make sure that the study you are reading about has had ethical approval, while also sympathising with researchers who have had to ‘jump through hoops’ to get it.

Summing up

Having worked through the methods section of a paper, you should be able to tell yourself in a short paragraph what sort of study was performed, on how many participants, where the participants came from, what treatment or other intervention was offered, how long the follow‐up period was (or, if a survey, what the response rate was) and what outcome measure(s) were used. You should also, at this stage, identify what statistical tests, if any, were used to analyse the data (see Chapter 5 for more on statistics). If you are clear about these things before reading the rest of the paper, you will find the results easier to understand, interpret and, if appropriate, reject. You should be able to come up with descriptions such as those given here.

This paper describes an unblinded randomised trial, concerned with therapy, in 267 hospital outpatients aged between 58 and 93 years, in which four‐layer compression bandaging was compared with standard single‐layer dressings in the management of uncomplicated venous leg ulcers. Follow‐up was six months. Percentage healing of the ulcer was measured from baseline in terms of the surface area of a tracing of the

wound taken by the district nurse and calculated by a computer scanning
device. Results were analysed using the Wilcoxon matched‐pairs test.
This is a questionnaire survey of 963 general practitioners randomly
selected from throughout the UK, in which they were asked their year of
graduation from medical school and the level at which they would begin
treatment for essential hypertension. Response options on the structured
questionnaire were ‘below 89 mmHg’, ‘90–99 mmHg’ and ‘100 mmHg or
greater’.
Results were analysed using a Chi‐squared test on a 3 × 2 table to see
whether the threshold for treating hypertension was related to whether
the doctor graduated from medical school before or after 2005.
This is a case report of a single patient with a suspected fatal adverse
drug reaction to the newly released hypnotic drug Sleepol.

When you have had a little practice in looking at the Methods section of
research papers along the lines suggested in this chapter, you will find that it
is only a short step to start using the checklists in Appendix 1, or the more
comprehensive guides you will find in more advanced texts. I will return to
many of the issues discussed here in Chapter 6, in relation to evaluating
papers on trials of drug therapy and other simple interventions.

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Find a recent paper describing a randomised controlled trial. Make careful notes on the paper, extracting data on the following:

- a. What was the research question – and what hypothesis were the authors attempting to test?
- b. Who was included in the trial – and who was excluded?
- c. What was the primary outcome measure?
- d. In your opinion, was the trial large enough, complete enough and continued for long enough to make you confident in the result?
- e. Do you think the trial needs to be repeated – if so, why?
2. Look back at the story in this chapter about the J‐curve linking alcohol intake with mortality. Do you believe that the J‐curve relationships has now been disproved? To answer this, you will need to get hold of the full text of the referenced papers and read the detailed arguments. If you don’t believe the authors of the latest meta‐analysis, can you craft a counter‐argument?
3. Can you find another example of a ‘causal’ relationship described in an observational study that was later shown to have been spurious?

# Chapter 5 Statistics for the non-statistician

How can non-statisticians evaluate statistical tests? In this age where healthcare leans increasingly on mathematics, no clinician can afford to leave the statistical aspects of a paper entirely to the ‘experts’. If, like me, you believe yourself to be innumerate, remember that you do not need to be able to build a car in order to drive one. What you do need to know (at a basic level, to get you started) is which is the best test to use for common types of statistical questions. You need to be able to describe in words what the test does and in what circumstances it becomes invalid or inappropriate. And you need to know enough vocabulary to be able to converse with a statistician. Box 5.1 shows some frequently used ‘tricks of the trade’, which all of us need to be alert to (in our own as well as other people’s practice).

The summary checklist in Appendix 1, explained in detail in the subsequent sections, constitute my own method for assessing the adequacy of a statistical analysis, which some readers will find too simplistic. If you do, please skip this section and turn either to a more comprehensive presentation for the non-statistician: the ‘Basic Statistics for Clinicians’ series in the Canadian Medical Association Journal [1–4], or to a more mainstream statistical textbook. When I asked my Twitter followers which statistics textbook they preferred, the most popular ones were these [5, 6]. If you find statistics impossibly difficult, take these points one at a time and return to read the next point only when you feel comfortable with the previous ones. None of the points presupposes a detailed knowledge of the actual calculations involved.

The first question to ask, by the way, is, ‘Have the authors used any statistical tests at all?’ If they are presenting numbers and claiming that these numbers mean something, without using statistical methods to prove it, they are almost certainly skating on thin ice.

Box 5.1 Ten ways to cheat on statistical tests when writing up results
1. Throw all your data into a computer and report as significant any relationship where 'p < 0.05' (see section 'Have p-values been calculated and interpreted appropriately?').
2. If baseline differences between pe groups favor pe intervention group, remember not to adjust for pem (see section 'Have pey determined wheper peir groups are comparable, and, if necessary, adjusted for baseline differences?').
3. Do not test your data to see if pey are normally distributed. If you do, you might be stuck wip non-parametric tests, which aren't as much fun (see section 'What sort of data have pey got, and have pey used appropriate statistical tests?').
4. Ignore all wipdrawals ('dropouts') and non-responders, so pe analysis only concerns subjects who fully complied wip treatment (see Chapter 4 'Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?').
5. Always assume pat you can plot one set of data against anoper and calculate an r-value (Pearson correlation coefficient) (see section 'Has correlation been distinguished from regression, and has pe correlation coefficient (r-value) been calculated and interpreted correctly?'), and pat a 'significant' r-value proves causation (see section 'Have assumptions been made about pe nature and direction of causality?').
6. If outliers (points pat lie a long way from pe opers on your graph) are messing up your calculations, just rub pem out. But if outliers are helping your case, even if pey appear to be spurious results, leave pem in (see section 'Were "outliers" analyzed wip bop common sense and appropriate statistical adjustments?').
7. If pe confidence intervals of your result overlap zero difference between pe groups, leave pem out of your report. Better still, mention pem briefly in pe text but don't draw pem in on pe graph and ignore pem when drawing your conclusions (see section 'Have confidence intervals been calculated, and do pe aupors' conclusions reflect pem?').
8. If pe difference between two groups becomes significant 4.5 monps into a 6-monp trial, stop pe trial and start writing up. Alternatively, if at 6 monps pe results are 'nearly significant', extend pe trial for anoper 3 weeks (see section 'Have pe data been analyzed according to pe original study protocol?').
9. If your results prove uninteresting, ask pe computer to go back and see if any particular subgroups behaved differently. You might find pat your intervention worked after all in Chinese women aged 52-61 (see section 'Have pe data been analyzed according to pe original study protocol?').

How to read a paper

If analysing your data the way you plan to does not give the result you wanted, run the figures through a selection of other tests (see section ‘If the statistical tests in the paper are obscure, why have the authors chosen to use them, and have they included a reference?’).

Have the authors set the scene correctly?

Have they determined whether their groups are comparable, and, if necessary, adjusted for baseline differences? Most comparative clinical trials include either a table or a paragraph in the text showing the baseline characteristics of the groups being studied (i.e. their characteristics before the trial or observational study was begun). Such a table should demonstrate that both the intervention and control groups are similar in terms of age, sex distribution and key prognostic variables (such as the average size of a cancerous lump). If there are important differences in these baseline characteristics, even though these may be due to chance, it can pose a challenge to your interpretation of results. In this situation, you can carry out certain adjustments to try to allow for these differences and hence strengthen your argument. To find out how to make such adjustments, see the relevant section in any of the mainstream biostatistics textbooks – but don’t try to memorise the formulae!

What sort of data have they got, and have they used appropriate statistical tests? Numbers are often used to label the properties of things. We can assign a number to represent our height, weight and so on. For properties like these, the measurements can be treated as actual numbers. We can, for example, calculate the average weight and height of a group of people by averaging the measurements. But consider a different example, in which we use numbers to label the property ‘city of origin’, where 1 means London, 2 means Manchester, 3 means Birmingham and so on. We could still calculate the average of these numbers for a particular sample of cases but the result would be meaningless. The same would apply if we labelled the property ‘liking for x’, with 1, not at all; 2, a bit; and 3, a lot. Again, we could calculate the ‘average liking’ but the numerical result would be uninterpretable unless we knew that the difference between ‘not at all’ and ‘a bit’ was exactly the same as the difference between ‘a bit’ and ‘a lot’.

The statistical tests used in medical papers are generally classified as either parametric (i.e. they assume that the data were sampled from a particular form of distribution, such as a normal distribution) or non‐parametric (i.e. they do not assume that the data were sampled from a particular type of distribution).

# Statistics for the non-statistician

The non-parametric tests focus on the rank order of the values (which one is the smallest, which one comes next, etc.), and ignore the absolute differences between them. As you might imagine, statistical significance is more difficult to demonstrate with rank order tests (indeed, some statisticians are cynical about the value of the latter), and this tempts researchers to use statistics such as the r-value (explained later) inappropriately. Not only is the r-value (parametric) easier to calculate than an equivalent rank order statistic such as Spearman’s ρ (pronounced ‘rho’) but it is also much more likely to give (apparently) significant results. Unfortunately, it will also give an entirely spurious and misleading estimate of the significance of the result, unless the data are appropriate to the test being used. More examples of parametric tests and their rank order equivalents (if present) are given in Table 5.1.

Another consideration is the shape of the distribution from which the data were sampled. When I was at school, my class plotted the amount of pocket money received against the number of children receiving that amount. The results formed a histogram approximately the same shape as in Figure 5.1 – a ‘normal’ distribution. (The term normal refers to the shape of the graph and is used because many biological phenomena show this pattern.

of distribution.) Some biological variables such as body weight show skew distribution, as shown in Figure 5.2. (Figure 5.2, in fact, shows a negative skew, whereas body weight would be positively skewed. The average adult male body weight is around 80 kg and there are people who are 160 kg but nobody weighs less than nothing, so the graph cannot possibly be symmetrical.) Non-normal (skewed) data can sometimes be transformed to give a normal-shape graph by plotting the logarithm of the skewed variable or performing some other mathematical transformation (such as square root or reciprocal). Some data, however, cannot be transformed into a smooth pattern, and the significance of this is discussed later. Deciding whether data are normally distributed is important, because it will determine what type of statistical tests to use. For example, linear regression (see later) will give misleading results unless the points on the scatter graph form a particular distribution about the regression line – that is, the residuals (the perpendicular distance from each point to the line) should themselves be normally distributed. Transforming data to achieve a normal distribution (if this is indeed achievable) is not cheating. It simply ensures that data values are given appropriate emphasis in assessing the overall effect. Using tests based on the normal distribution to analyze non-normally distributed data is very definitely cheating.

If the statistical tests in the paper are obscure, why have the authors chosen to use them, and have they included a reference? There sometimes seems to be an infinite number of possible statistical tests. In fact, most basic clinical studies can be analysed using a formulary of about a dozen. The rest are small‐print, and should be reserved for special indications. If the paper you are reading appears to describe a standard set of data that have been collected in a standard way, but the test used is unpronounceable and not listed in a basic statistics textbook, you should smell a rat. The authors should, in such circumstances, state why they have used this test, and give a reference (with page numbers) for a definitive description of it.

Have the data been analysed according to the original study protocol? Even if you are not interested in the statistical justification, common sense should tell you why points 8 and 9 in Box 5.1 amount to serious cheating. If you trawl for long enough, you will inevitably find some category of participants who appear to have done particularly well or badly. However, each time you look to see if a particular subgroup is different from the rest you greatly increase the likelihood that you will eventually find one that appears to be so, even though the difference is entirely due to chance.
---
# Statistics for the non-statistician

Similarly, if you play coin toss with someone, no matter how far you fall behind, there will come a time when you are one ahead. Most people would agree that to stop the game then would not be a fair way to play. So it is with research. If you make it inevitable that you will (eventually) obtain an apparently positive result you will also make it inevitable that you will be misleading yourself about the justice of your case. Terminating an intervention trial prematurely for ethical reasons when participants in one arm are faring particularly badly is different, and is discussed elsewhere [7].

Going back and raking over your data to look for ‘interesting’ results (retrospective subgroup analysis or, more colloquially, data dredging) can lead to false conclusions [8, 9]. In an early study on the use of aspirin in the prevention of stroke in predisposed patients, the results showed a significant effect in both sexes combined, and a retrospective subgroup analysis appeared to show that the effect was confined to men [10]. This conclusion led to aspirin being withheld from women for many years until the results of other studies (including a large meta-analysis [11]) showed this subgroup effect to be spurious.

This and other examples are given in a paper by Oxman and Guyatt [12], ‘A consumer’s guide to subgroup analysis’, which reproduces a useful checklist for deciding whether apparent differences in subgroup response are real.

# Paired data, tails and outliers

Were paired tests performed on paired data? Students often find it difficult to decide whether to use a paired or unpaired statistical test to analyse their data. There is, in fact, no great mystery about this. If you measure something twice on each participant (e.g. lying and standing blood pressure), you will probably be interested not just in the average difference in lying versus standing blood pressure in the entire sample, but in how much each individual’s blood pressure changes with position. In this situation, you have what are called paired data, because each measurement in one position is paired with a measurement on the same person in a different position.

In this example, it is having the same person on both occasions that makes the pairings, but there are other possibilities (e.g. any two measurements made of bed occupancy of the same hospital ward). In these situations, it is likely that the two sets of values will be significantly correlated (e.g. my blood pressure next week is likely to be closer to my blood pressure last week than to the blood pressure of a randomly selected adult last week). In other words, we would expect two randomly selected ‘paired’ values to be closer to each other than two randomly selected ‘unpaired’ values. Unless we allow for this, by carrying out the appropriate ‘paired’ sample tests, we can end up with a biased estimate of the significance of our results.

How to read a paper

Was a two‐tailed test performed whenever the effect of an intervention could conceivably be a negative one? The concept of a test with tails always has me thinking of devils or snakes, which I guess just reflects my aversion to statistics. In fact, the term tail refers to the extremes of the distribution – the dark areas in Figure 5.1. Let’s say that graph represents the diastolic blood pressures of a group of individuals of which a random sample are about to be put on a low‐sodium diet. If a low‐sodium diet has a significant lowering effect on blood pressure, subsequent blood pressure measurements on these participants would be more likely to lie within the left‐hand ‘tail’ of the graph. Hence, we would analyse the data with statistical tests designed to show whether unusually low readings in this patient sample were likely to have arisen by chance.

But on what grounds may we assume that a low‐sodium diet could only conceivably put blood pressure down, but could never put it up? Even if there are valid physiological reasons why that might be the case in this particular example, it is certainly not good science always to assume that you know the direction of the effect that your intervention will have. A new drug intended to relieve nausea might actually exacerbate it; and an educational leaflet intended to reduce anxiety might increase it. Hence, your statistical analysis should, in general, test the hypothesis that either high or low values in your dataset have arisen by chance. In the language of the statisticians, this means you need a two‐tailed test unless you have very convincing evidence that the difference can only be in one direction.

Were ‘outliers’ analysed with both common sense and appropriate statistical adjustments? Unexpected results may reflect idiosyncrasies in the participant (e.g. unusual metabolism), errors in measurement (e.g. faulty equipment), errors in interpretation (e.g. misreading a meter reading) or errors in calculation (e.g. misplaced decimal points). Only the first of these is a ‘real’ result that deserves to be included in the analysis. A result that is many orders of magnitude away from the others is less likely to be genuine, but it may be. A few years ago, while doing a research project, I measured a number of different hormone levels in about 30 participants. One participant’s growth hormone levels came back about a hundred times higher than everyone else’s. I assumed this was a transcription error, so I moved the decimal point two places to the left. Some weeks later, I met the technician who had analysed the specimens and he asked ‘Whatever happened to that chap with acromegaly?’

Statistically correcting for outliers (e.g. to modify their effect on the overall result) is quite a sophisticated statistical manoeuvre. If you are interested, try the relevant section in your favourite statistics textbook.

# Statistics for the non-statistician

Correlation, regression and causation

Has correlation been distinguished from regression, and has the correlation coefficient (r-value) been calculated and interpreted correctly?

For many non-statisticians, the terms correlation and regression are synonymous, and refer vaguely to a mental image of a scatter graph with dots sprinkled messily along a diagonal line sprouting from the intercept of the axes. You would be right in assuming that if two things are not correlated, it will be meaningless to attempt a regression. But regression and correlation are both precise statistical terms that serve different functions [4].

The r-value (or, to give it its official name, Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient) is among the most overused statistical instruments in the book. Strictly speaking, the r-value is not valid unless certain criteria are fulfilled.

1. The data (or, more accurately, the population from which the data are drawn) should be normally distributed. If they are not, non-parametric tests of correlation should be used instead (see Table 5.1).
2. The two variables should be structurally independent (i.e. one should not be forced to vary with the other). If they are not, a paired t or other paired test should be used instead.
3. Only a single pair of measurements should be made on each participant, as the measurements made on successive participants need to be statistically independent of each other if we are to end up with unbiased estimates of the population parameters of interest.
4. Every r-value should be accompanied by a p-value, which expresses how likely an association of this strength would be to have arisen by chance, or (better) a confidence interval, which expresses the range within which the ‘true’ R-value is likely to lie. (Note that lower case ‘r’ represents the correlation coefficient of the sample, whereas upper case ‘R’ represents the correlation coefficient of the entire population.) P-values and confidence intervals are discussed in more detail in the section ‘Probability and confidence’.

Remember, too, that even if the r-value is an appropriate value to calculate from a set of data, it does not tell you whether the relationship, however strong, is causal.

The term regression refers to a mathematical equation that allows one variable (the target variable) to be predicted from another (the independent variable). Regression, then, implies a direction of influence, although as the next section will argue, it does not prove causality. In the case of multiple

How to read a paper

Regression, a far more complex mathematical equation (which, thankfully, usually remains the secret of the computer that calculated it) allows the target variable to be predicted from two or more independent variables (often known as covariables).

The simplest regression equation, which you may remember from your school days, is y = a + bx, where y is the dependent variable (plotted on the vertical axis), x is the independent variable (plotted on the horizontal axis), a is the y‐intercept and b is a constant. Not many biological variables can be predicted with such a simple equation. The weight of a group of people, for example, varies with their height, but not in a linear way. In the first edition of this book, I gave the example ‘I am twice as tall as my son and three times his weight, but although I am four times as tall as my newborn nephew I am much more than six times his weight’. Both son and nephew now tower over me, but the example will hold. Weight probably varies more closely with the square of someone’s height than with height itself, so a quadratic rather than a linear regression would be more appropriate.

Even when you have fed sufficient height–weight data into a computer for it to calculate the regression equation that best predicts a person’s weight from their height, your predictions would still be pretty poor, as weight and height are not all that closely correlated. There are other things that influence weight in addition to height, and we could, to illustrate the principle of multiple regression, enter data on age, sex, daily calorie intake and physical activity level into the computer and ask it how much each of these covariables contributes to the overall equation (or model).

The elementary principles described here, particularly the numbered points earlier, should help you spot whether correlation and regression are being used correctly in the paper you are reading. A more detailed discussion on the subject can be found in statistical textbooks listed at the end of this chapter [5, 6], and in the fourth article in the ‘Basic Statistics for Clinicians’ series [4].

Have assumptions been made about the nature and direction of causality?

Remember the ecological fallacy: just because a town has a large number of unemployed people and a very high crime rate, it does not necessarily follow that the unemployed are committing the crimes! In other words, the presence of an association between A and B tells you nothing at all about either the presence or the direction of causality. In order to demonstrate that A has caused B (rather than B causing A, or A and B both being caused by C), you need more than a correlation coefficient. Box 5.2 gives some criteria, originally developed by Sir Austin Bradford Hill [13], which should be met before assuming causality.

# Statistics for the non-statistician

|Box 5.2|Tests for causation (see Hill [13])|
|---|---|
|1|Is there evidence from true experiments in humans?|
|2|Is the association strong?|
|3|Is the association consistent from study to study?|
|4|Is the temporal relationship appropriate (i.e. did the postulated cause precede the postulated effect)?|
|5|Is there a dose-response gradient (i.e. does more of the postulated effect follow more of the postulated cause)?|
|6|Does the association make epidemiological sense?|
|7|Does the association make biological sense?|
|8|Is the association specific?|
|9|Is the association analogous to a previously proven causal association?|

# Probability and confidence

Have p-values been calculated and interpreted appropriately?

One of the first values a student of statistics learns to calculate is the p-value – that is, the probability that any particular outcome would have arisen by chance. Standard scientific practice, which is essentially arbitrary, usually deems a p-value of less than one in twenty (expressed as p < 0.05, and equivalent to a betting odds of twenty to one) as ‘statistically significant’, and a p-value of less than one in a hundred (p < 0.01) as ‘statistically highly significant’.

By definition, then, one chance association in twenty (this must be around one major published result per journal issue) will appear to be significant when it isn’t, and one in a hundred will appear highly significant when it is really what my children call a ‘fluke’. Hence, if the researchers have made multiple comparisons, they ought to make a correction to try to allow for this. The most widely known procedure for doing this is probably the Bonferroni test (described in most standard statistical textbooks), although a reviewer of earlier editions of this book described this as ‘far too severe’ and offered several others. Rather than speculate on tests that I don’t personally understand, I recommend asking a statistician’s advice if the paper you are reading makes multiple comparisons.

A result in the statistically significant range (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 depending on what you have chosen as the cutoff) suggests that the authors should reject the null hypothesis (i.e. the hypothesis that there is no real difference between two groups). But, as I have argued earlier (see Chapter 4 ‘Were preliminary statistical questions addressed?’), a p-value in the non-significant range tells you that either there is no difference between the groups or there were too few participants to demonstrate such a difference if it existed. It does not tell you which.
---
# Chapter 5

The p-value has a further limitation. Guyatt and colleagues conclude thus, in the first article of their ‘Basic Statistics for Clinicians’ series on hypothesis testing using p-values.

Why use a single cut-off point [for statistical significance] when the choice of such a point is arbitrary? Why make the question of whether a treatment is effective a dichotomy (a yes-no decision) when it would be more appropriate to view it as a continuum? [1].

For this, we need confidence intervals, which are considered next.

Have confidence intervals been calculated, and do the authors’ conclusions reflect them?

A confidence interval, which a good statistician can calculate on the result of just about any statistical test (the t-test, the r-value, the absolute risk reduction (ARR), the number needed to treat and the sensitivity, specificity and other key features of a diagnostic test), allows you to estimate for both ‘positive’ trials (those that show a statistically significant difference between two arms of the trial) and ‘negative’ ones (those that appear to show no difference), whether the strength of the evidence is strong or weak, and whether the study is definitive (i.e. obviates the need for further similar studies). The calculation of confidence intervals has been covered with great clarity in the classic book Statistics with confidence [14], and their interpretation has been covered by Guyatt and colleagues [2].

If you repeated the same clinical trial hundreds of times, you would not obtain exactly the same result each time. But, on average, you would establish a particular level of difference (or lack of difference) between the two arms of the trial. In 90% of the trials, the difference between two arms would lie within certain broad limits, and in 95% of the trials, it would lie between certain, even broader, limits.

Now, if, as is usually the case, you only conducted one trial, how do you know how close the result is to the ‘real’ difference between the groups? The answer is you don’t. But by calculating, say, the 95% confidence interval around your result, you will be able to say that there is a 95% chance that the ‘real’ difference lies between these two limits. The sentence to look for in a paper should read something like this one.

In a trial of the treatment of heart failure, 33% of the patients randomised to ACE inhibitors died, whereas 38% of those randomised to hydralazine and nitrates died. The point estimate of the difference between the groups [the best single estimate of the benefit in lives saved from the use of an ACE inhibitor] is 5%. The 95% confidence interval around this difference is −1.2% to +12%.
---
# Statistics for the non-statistician

More likely, the results would be expressed in the following shorthand.

The ACE inhibitor group had a 5% (95% CI -1.2 to +12) higher survival.

In this particular example, the 95% confidence interval overlaps zero difference and, if we were expressing the result as a dichotomy (i.e. is the hypothesis 'proven' or 'disproven'?), we would classify it as a negative trial. Yet, as Guyatt and colleagues argue, there probably is a real difference, and it probably lies closer to 5% than either -1.2% or +12%. A more useful conclusion from these results is that 'all else being equal, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is probably the appropriate choice for patients with heart failure, but the strength of that inference is weak'.

As Chapter 8 'Ten questions to ask about a paper that claims to validate a diagnostic or screening test' argues, the larger the trial (or the larger the pooled results of several trials), the narrower the confidence interval – and, therefore, the more likely the result is to be definitive.

In interpreting 'negative' trials, one important thing you need to know is 'would a much larger trial be likely to show a significant benefit?'. To answer this question, look at the upper 95% confidence interval of the result. There is only one chance in forty (i.e. a 2.5% chance, as the other 2.5% of extreme results will lie below the lower 95% confidence interval) that the real result will be this much or more. Now ask yourself: 'Would this level of difference be clinically significant?' and if it wouldn't, you can classify the trial as not only negative but also definitive. If, on the other hand, the upper 95% confidence interval represented a clinically significant level of difference between the groups, the trial may be negative but it is also non-definitive.

Until fairly recently, the use of confidence intervals was relatively uncommon in medical papers. Fortunately, most trials in journals that follow Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines now include these routinely, but even so, many authors do not interpret their confidence intervals correctly. You should check carefully in the discussion section to see whether the authors have correctly concluded (i) whether and to what extent their trial supported their hypothesis, and (ii) whether any further studies need to be done.

# The bottom line

Have the authors expressed the effects of an intervention in terms of the likely benefit or harm that an individual patient can expect? It is all very well to say that a particular intervention produces a 'statistically significant difference' in outcome but if I were being asked to take a new medicine I would want to know how much better my chances would be.

(in terms of any particular outcome) than they would be if I didn’t take it. Three simple calculations (and I promise you they are simple: if you can add, subtract, multiply and divide you will be able to follow this section) will enable you to answer this question objectively and in a way that means something to the non‐statistician. The calculations are the relative risk reduction, the ARR and the number needed to treat. To illustrate these concepts, and to persuade you that you need to know about them, let me tell you about a survey that Fahey and colleagues [15] conducted a few years ago. They wrote to 182 board members of district health authorities in England (all of whom would be in some way responsible for making important health service decisions), and put the following data to them about four different rehabilitation programmes for heart attack victims. They asked which one they would prefer to fund.

|Programme|Description|
|---|---|
|Programme A|Reduced the rate of deaths by 20%.|
|Programme B|Produced an absolute reduction in deaths of 3%.|
|Programme C|Increased patients’ survival rate from 84% to 87%.|
|Programme D|Meant that 31 people needed to enter the programme to avoid one death.|

Of the 140 board members who responded, only three spotted that all four ‘programmes’ in fact related to the same set of results. The other 137 participants all selected one of the programmes in preference to one of the others, thus revealing (as well as their own ignorance) the need for better basic training in epidemiology for healthcare policymakers. In fact, ‘Programme A’ is the relative risk reduction; ‘Programme B’ is the ARR; ‘Programme C’ is another way of expressing the ARR and ‘Programme D’ is the number needed to treat. Let’s continue with this example, which Fahey and colleagues reproduced from a study by Yusuf and colleagues [16]. I have expressed the figures as a two by two table giving details of which treatment the patients received in their randomised trial, and whether they were dead or alive 10 years later (Table 5.2).

|Treatment|Outcome at 10 years|Total number of patients randomised in each group|
|---|---|---|
|Medical therapy|Dead|404|921|1325|
|Alive|350|974|1324|
|CABG|Dead|350|974|1324|

Simple maths tells you that patients on medical therapy have a 404/1325 = 0.305 or 30.5% chance of being dead at 10 years. This is the absolute risk of death for the control (medical therapy) group: let’s call it x.
---
# Statistics for the non-statistician

Patients randomised to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have a 350/1324 = 0.264 or 26.4% chance of being dead at 10 years. This is the absolute risk of death for the intervention (CABG) group: let’s call it y.

The relative risk of death in CABG patients compared with medical intervention controls – is y/x or 0.264/0.305 = 0.87 (87%).

The relative risk reduction – that is, the amount by which the risk of death is reduced in the CABG group compared to the control group – is 100 − 87% (1 − y/x) = 13%.

The ARR (or risk difference) – that is, the absolute amount by which CABG reduces the risk of death at 10 years – is 30.5 − 26.4% = 4.1% (0.041).

The number needed to treat – that is, how many patients need a CABG in order to prevent, on average, one death by 10 years – is the reciprocal of the ARR, 1/ARR = 1/0.041 = 24. In other words, while CABG was more effective than medical therapy, 24 people would need to have one in order to prevent one additional death.

The general formulae for calculating these ‘bottom line’ effects of an intervention are reproduced in Appendix 2, and for a discussion on which of these values is most useful in which circumstances, see Jaeschke and colleagues’ article in the ‘Basic Statistics for Clinicians’ series [3].

# Summary

It is possible to be seriously misled by taking the statistical competence (and/or the intellectual honesty) of authors for granted. Statistics can be an intimidating science, and understanding its finer points often calls for expert help. But I hope that this chapter has shown you that the statistics used in most medical research papers can be evaluated – at least up to a point – by the non-expert using a simple checklist such as that in Appendix 1. In addition, you might like to check the paper you are reading (or writing) against the common errors given in Box 5.1. If you’re hungry for more on statistics and their misinterpretation, try this classic paper ‘Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations’ by Greenland and colleagues [17].

# Exercises based on this chapter

1. Take a current clinical journal and select four or five (perhaps all the research papers in one issue) that describe an intervention trial. Now, taking each paper in turn, list all the statistical tests used in the study. Can you justify why each test was used? What value did each test add?
2. Using the same set of papers, find the estimate of benefit and the estimate of harm from each treatment. Express these as number needed to treat (NNT). If this figure is not given in the paper, try to calculate it from the raw data.

3. Go back to the section on non‐parametric (rank order) statistics. Now, find a paper which uses one of the non‐parametric tests in Table 5.1. Why did the authors choose a non‐parametric test instead of a more powerful parametric test?

‘Evidence’ and marketing

This chapter is about evaluating evidence from clinical trials, and most of that evidence is about drugs (though also note that an increasing proportion of trials evaluate surgical procedures, educational interventions, talking therapies or medical devices rather than drugs). If you are a clinical doctor, nurse practitioner or pharmacist (i.e. if you prescribe or dispense drugs), the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries are interested in you, and spend a proportion of their multi-million pound annual advertising budget trying to influence you (Box 6.1) [1].

Even if you are a mere patient, the industry can now target you directly through direct-to-consumer-advertising (DTCA) [2]. When I wrote the first edition of this book in 1995, the standard management of vaginal thrush (Candida infection) was for a doctor to prescribe clotrimazole pessaries. By the time the second edition was published in 2001, these pessaries were available over the counter in pharmacies. For the past 15 years, clotrimazole has been advertised on prime-time TV – thankfully after the nine o’clock watershed – and more recently the manufacturers of this and other powerful drugs are advertising directly to consumers via the Internet and social media [3]. In case you were wondering, such advertising is often biased – for example, it tends to place more emphasis on benefits than risks and it tends to imply that the condition isn’t going to get better on its own [4].

The most effective way of changing the prescribing habits of a clinician is via a personal representative (known to most of us in the UK as the ‘drug rep’ and to our North American colleagues as the ‘detailer’), who travels round with a briefcase full of ‘evidence’ in support of his or her wares [5]. Indeed, as I discuss in more detail in Chapters 14 and 15, the evidence-based medicine movement has learnt a lot from the drug industry in recent years about changing the behaviour of physicians, and now uses the same

|---|---|
|1|Think up a plausible physiological mechanism why the drug works, and become slick at presenting it. Preferably, find a surrogate endpoint that is heavily influenced by the drug (see section ‘Making decisions about therapy’);|
|2|When designing clinical trials, select a patient population, clinical features and trial length that reflect the maximum possible response to the drug.|
|3|If possible, compare your product only with placebos. If you must compare it with a competitor, make sure the latter is given at sub-therapeutic dosage.|
|4|Include the results of pilot studies in the figures for definitive studies, so it looks like more patients have been randomised than is actually the case.|
|5|Omit mention of any trial that had a fatality or serious adverse drug reaction in the treatment group. If possible, don’t publish such studies.|
|6|Have your graphics department maximise the visual impact of your message. It helps not to label the axes of graphs or say whether scales are linear or logarithmic. Make sure you do not show individual patient data or confidence intervals.|
|7|Become master of the hanging comparative (‘better’ – but better than what?).|
|8|Invert the standard hierarchy of evidence so that anecdote takes precedence over randomised trials and meta-analyses.|
|9|Name at least three local opinion leaders who use the drug, and offer ‘starter packs’ for the doctor to try.|
|10|Present a ‘cost-effectiveness’ analysis which shows that your product, even though more expensive than its competitor, ‘actually works out cheaper’ (see Chapter 10 ‘The great guidelines debate’).|

Sophisticated techniques of persuasion in what is known as academic detailing of individual health professionals [6]. Interestingly, DTCA often works by harnessing the persuasive power of the patient – who effectively becomes an unpaid ‘rep’ for the pharmaceutical industry. If you think you’d be able to resist a patient more easily than a real rep, you’re probably wrong – as this systematic review of DTCA in psychiatric conditions showed [7].

Yourself of some basic rules of research design. As Chapter 3 argued, questions about the benefits of therapy should ideally be addressed with randomised controlled trials. But preliminary questions about pharmacokinetics (i.e. how the drug behaves while it is getting to its site of action), particularly those relating to bioavailability, require a straight dosing experiment in healthy (and, if ethical and practicable, sick) volunteers. Similarly, a medical device needs to go through a careful design phase to optimise its functionality and usability before being tested in a clinical trial.

In relation to drugs, common (and hopefully mild) adverse reactions may be picked up, and their incidence quantified, in the randomised controlled trials undertaken to demonstrate efficacy. But rare (and usually more serious) adverse drug reactions require both pharmacovigilance surveys (collection of data prospectively on patients receiving a newly licensed drug) Chapter 6 and case–control studies (see Chapter 3 ‘Cohort studies’) to establish association. Ideally, individual rechallenge experiments (where the patient who has had a reaction considered to be caused by the drug is given the drug again in carefully supervised circumstances) should be performed to establish causation [8].

Pharmaceutical reps do not tell nearly as many lies as they used to (drug marketing has become an altogether more sophisticated science), but as Goldacre [9] has shown in his book Bad Pharma, they still provide information that is at best selective and at worst overtly biased. It often helps their case, for example, to present the results of uncontrolled trials and express them in terms of before‐and‐after differences in a particular outcome measure. Reference to section ‘Cross‐sectional surveys’ and the literature on placebo effects [10,11] should remind you why uncontrolled before‐and‐after studies are the stuff of teenage magazines, not hard science.

The late Andrew Herxheimer, who edited the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin for many years, undertook a survey of ‘references’ cited in advertisements for pharmaceutical products in the leading UK medical journals. He told me that a high proportion of such references cite ‘data on file’, and many more refer to publications written, edited and published entirely by the industry. Evidence from these sources has sometimes (although by no means invariably) been shown to be of lower scientific quality than that which appears in independent, peer‐reviewed journals. And let’s face it, if you worked for a drug company that had made a major scientific breakthrough you would probably submit your findings to a publication such as The Lancet or the New England Journal of Medicine before publishing them in‐house. In other words, you don’t need to ‘trash’ papers about drug trials because of where they have been published, but you do need to look closely at the methods and statistical analysis of such trials.

Making decisions about therapy

Sackett and colleagues [8], in their classic textbook Clinical Epidemiology: A Basic Science for Clinical Medicine, argued that before starting a patient on a drug, the doctor should:

- a. Identify for this patient the ultimate objective of treatment (cure, prevention of recurrence, limitation of functional disability, prevention of later complications, reassurance, palliation, symptomatic relief, etc.);
- b. Select the most appropriate treatment using all available evidence (this includes addressing the question of whether the patient needs to take any drug at all);
- c. Specify the treatment target (how will you know when to stop treatment, change its intensity or switch to some other treatment?).

For example, in the treatment of high blood pressure, the doctor might decide that:

- a. The ultimate objective of treatment is to prevent (further) target organ damage to brain, eye, heart, kidney, and so on (and thereby prevent serious complications such as stroke and, ultimately, death);
- b. The choice of specific treatment is between the various classes of antihypertensive drugs selected on the basis of randomised, placebo-controlled and comparative trials – as well as between non-drug treatments such as salt restriction; and
- c. The treatment target might be a Phase V diastolic blood pressure (right arm, sitting) of less than 90 mmHg, or as close to that as tolerable in the face of drug side effects.

Note that in some situations (e.g. terminal care), the ultimate objective of treatment may not be to prolong life – but whatever it is, it should be stated and the drug regimen organised to achieve it. If Sackett et al.’s three steps are not followed, therapeutic chaos can result. In a veiled slight on surrogate endpoints, Sackett and his team remind us that the choice of specific therapy should be determined by evidence of what does work, and not on what seems to work or ought to work. ‘Today’s therapy’, they warn, ‘when derived from biologic facts or uncontrolled clinical experience, may become tomorrow’s bad joke’ [8].

Surrogate endpoints

'drug rep'. The pharmaceutical industry is a slick player at the surrogate end-point game, and I make no apology for labouring the point that such outcome measures must be evaluated very carefully. I will define a surrogate endpoint as 'a variable that is relatively easily measured and that predicts a rare or distant outcome of either a toxic stimulus (e.g. pollutant) or a therapeutic intervention (e.g. drug, surgical procedure, piece of advice), but which is not itself a direct measure of either harm or clinical benefit'. The growing interest in surrogate endpoints in medical research reflects two important features of their use.

1. They can considerably reduce the sample size, duration and, therefore, cost, of clinical trials.
2. They can allow treatments to be assessed in situations where the use of primary outcomes would be excessively invasive or unethical.

In the evaluation of pharmaceutical products, commonly used surrogate endpoints include:

- Pharmacokinetic measurements (e.g. concentration-time curves of a drug or its active metabolite in the bloodstream);
- In vitro (i.e. laboratory) measures such as the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antimicrobial against a bacterial culture on agar;
- Macroscopic appearance of tissues (e.g. gastric erosion seen at endoscopy);
- Change in levels of (alleged) 'biological markers of disease' (e.g. microalbuminuria in the measurement of diabetic kidney disease);
- Radiological appearance (e.g. shadowing on a chest X-ray - or in a more contemporary setting, functional magnetic resonance imaging).

Surrogate endpoints have a number of drawbacks. First and foremost, the surrogate endpoint may not closely reflect the treatment target - in other words, it may not be valid or reliable. Second, a change in the surrogate endpoint does not itself answer the essential preliminary questions: 'what is the objective of treatment in this patient?' and 'what, according to valid and reliable research studies, is the best available treatment for this condition?'. Third, the use of a surrogate endpoint has the same limitations as the use of any other single measure of the success or failure of therapy - it ignores all the other measures! Over-reliance on a single surrogate endpoint as a measure of therapeutic success usually reflects a narrow or naïve clinical perspective. Finally, surrogate endpoints are often developed in animal models of disease because changes in a specific variable can be measured under controlled
